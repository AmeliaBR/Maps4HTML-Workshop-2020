23:57 <AmeliaBR> Ready for Week 2! Today's agenda https://discourse.wicg.io/c/web-mapping/22
23:57 <prushforth> Welcome!
23:58 <Helixopp> Good evening everyone... David Fazio dfazio@helixopp.com
23:59 <prushforth> Thanks to everyone staying up late or getting up early
00:02 <prushforth> Claudia's video: https://cloudstore.zih.tu-dresden.de/index.php/s/Z5SfoojCfLCwdLq 
00:08 <IvanSanchez_gitlab> [coffee zombie.gif]
00:09 <Helixopp> 2 types of memory: 1. Recall 2. Recognition. Maps deals with recognition. Important cognitive aspects of recognition: Attention, Perception, Memory  
00:11 <AmeliaBR> Topic: Physical accessibility data in maps
00:11 <prushforth> https://wheelmap.org
00:12 <AmeliaBR> discourse page: https://discourse.wicg.io/t/physical-accessibility-data-in-maps/4852
00:12 <IvanSanchez_gitlab> Ooohhh, semiotics of "sharper edges" = "more dangerous", nice detail
00:13 <Helixopp> For maps that identify accessible spaces: I've seen several of these from different providers around the world. Is there plans to standardize, share information, and collaborate to provide a fully functional global solution?
00:17 <Helixopp> 1 interesting thing: physical accessibility specs vary widely by country. For example accessible ramps in Latin America are much steeper, and almost impossible to traverse without assistance than in other regions of the world. Whereas in US the slope is much more gradual. Providing that specific info would be important.
00:22 <thehabes> Definitely screaming Linked Data...is `accessibility` your own thing?
00:24 <thehabes> Yes! `@context` lets you have that description, and new data practices let you mix and match contexts as you need to combine and better supplement data, whether you own it or not.  
00:27 <prushforth> Sebastian Felix: Why would you need all the <meta> elements in a MapML <feature>?  Aren't the semantic properties already specifiable in microformats or rdfa?
00:27 <shepazu> FWIW, that markup didn't indicate that it was a hotel
00:28 <shepazu> yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
00:28 <prushforth> I LOVE the idea
00:28 <fredesch> Are your accessibility  icons standardized/widely used?
00:31 <Helixopp> The SEO argument has been around for websites for a long time, without much success.
00:31 <Helixopp> Is this meant to supplement what hospitality providers are already doing, or replace it?
00:32 <Helixopp> Hotels mostly provide their a11y info
00:33 <thehabes> @prushforth  It's nice to see that a lot of people are using the syntax but struggling to fit their vocabulary in.  At least the right pieces are modularized.  Supporting all of us, or generally supporting Linked Data schema and context, means allowing MapML to take on context.  MapML can't possible pick and choose, but rather can support extension and, and standardized context inclusion, possibly through `<link
00:33 <thehabes> href="">`ing them in.  Like with how it links in coordinate systems, for example. 
00:34 <thehabes> Very nice presentation Sebastion, your thoughts are not entirely siloed.
00:35 <thehabes> The key is keeping the vocabulary modular so the spec doesn't depend on it, but can include it.
00:35 <ghobona> Great presentation Sebastian!
00:35 <parths0609> Very interesting presentation on accessibility. 
00:36 <AmeliaBR> Topic: Indoor maps
00:40 <AmeliaBR> discourse: https://discourse.wicg.io/t/indoor-maps-floorplans/4853/2
00:40 <AmeliaBR> Accessible Maps project: https://accessiblemaps.de/?page_id=121&lang=en
00:41 <thehabes> In my experience, in general there is no schema on the web that describes the Senses in any way.  I hope I am wrong.
00:42 <fredesch> How do you deal with poor signal strength in buildings?
00:42 <Helixopp> [edit] For maps that identify accessible spaces: I've seen several of these from different providers around the world. Is there plans to standardize, share information, and collaborate to provide a fully functional global solution?
00:42 <opyh> Yes:
00:42 <opyh> - You can mark your places on OpenStreetMap including indoor tagging (as shown by the talk happening right now)
00:42 <opyh> - As a data provider, you can use A11yJSON / accessibility.cloud. Even if you don't have the technical abilities to generate A11yJSON, you can contact Sozialhelden e.V. in Berlin for this and we help you transforming your data into the harmonized data aformat.
00:42 <opyh> - You could add schema.org on your webpage, e.g. as JSON-LD. When schema.org adds accessibility features, you can use them.
00:42 <thehabes> Download the data ahead of time is a method, link how Google maps downloads the data around you and can work offline.
00:44 <thehabes> [edit] Download the data ahead of time is a method, like how Google maps downloads the data around you and can work offline.
00:45 <Helixopp> [edit] 1 interesting thing: physical accessibility specs vary widely by country. For example accessible ramps in Latin America are much steeper, and almost impossible to traverse without assistance than in other regions of the world. Whereas in US the slope is much more gradual. Providing that specific info would be important.
00:45 <opyh> Good point, that's why we built a steepness property into A11yJSON (https://sozialhelden.github.io/a11yjson/3-interfaces/#ground). You can also tag the steepness of a ramp or surface on OpenStreetMap (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:incline), and in the GTFS pathways extension as `max_slope` (for public transit, https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#pathwaystxt)
00:46 <thehabes> [edit] Definitely screaming Linked Data...is `accessibility` your own thing?
00:46 <opyh> Yes, `accessibility` is our own thing but we want this (or something better!) to be a community standard
00:47 <Helixopp> I wonder if the 3d photo/video capability of smartphones can be used to auto generate accessibility of environment info? 
00:47 <prushforth> [edit] Sebastian Felix: Why would you need all the <meta> elements in a MapML <feature>?  Aren't the semantic properties already specifiable in microformats or rdfa?
00:47 <opyh> Yes they are – `<meta>` is a tag that the RDFa extension would add to MapML in this case
00:48 <Helixopp> Great. That's a big step forward
00:48 <Helixopp> [edit] For maps that identify accessible spaces: I've seen several of these from different providers around the world. Is there plans to standardize, share information, and collaborate to provide a fully functional global solution?
00:48 <thehabes> Accessibility data can be and should be 5 star (open) data too.  Good presentation.
00:49 <shepazu> COGA! COGA!
00:50 <prushforth> [edit] Sebastian Felix: Why would you need all the <meta> elements in a MapML <feature>?  Aren't the semantic properties already specifiable in microformats or rdfa?
00:50 <opyh> See example 36 on https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/
00:51 <Helixopp> [edit] I wonder if the 3d photo/video capability of smartphones can be used to auto generate accessibility of environment info? 
00:51 <claudialoitsch> Hi David, we are working on a similar solution. Using computer vision (i.e. image segmentation) approaches to collect as many information as possible based on video material
00:51 <AmeliaBR> Topic: Web Maps for Cognitive Accessibility — panel
00:51 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
00:51 <opyh> The syntax is just RDFa :) It could be JSON-LD as well, of course.

00:54 <AmeliaBR> From Chris Little in the Zoom chat:  10:52 PM
00:54 <AmeliaBR> Apple is proposing its indoor mapping system IMDF as a community standard in OGC now, and it will be open for public comment.
00:54 <AmeliaBR> 
00:54 <AmeliaBR> From David Fazio:  10:53 PM
00:54 <AmeliaBR> Didn’t Apple buy an indoor mapping company and kill it like 10 years ago?
00:54 <AmeliaBR> 
00:54 <ghobona> Great presentation Claudia & Julian! Indoor mapping is becoming increasingly important. The OGC [IndoorGML](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-005r5/14-005r5.html) standard is relevant to this topic. 
00:56 <ghobona> Note the recent [work done](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/19-032.html) by OGC and NIST on indoor mapping for public safety.
00:56 <AmeliaBR> > 2 types of memory: 1. Recall 2. Recognition. Maps deals with recognition. Important cognitive aspects of recognition: Attention, Perception, Memory  
00:56 <AmeliaBR> 
00:56 <AmeliaBR> The 3 aspects David's talking about
01:00 <AmeliaBR> We'll have time for a few audience questions, if you leave them here…
01:00 <ghobona> [edit] Great presentation Claudia & Julian! Indoor mapping is becoming increasingly important. The OGC [IndoorGML](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-005r5/14-005r5.html) standard is relevant to this topic. 
01:00 <claudialoitsch> Thank you! One of our objectives is to automatically detect as many information as possible from the existing indoor plan (escape plan, architectural drawings, BIM, etc.) and to provide different georeferenced output formats as well. We already started to create maps in IndoorGML but the problem ist to model the granular information need of people with disabilities to ensure they can really make use from
01:00 <claudialoitsch> information in maps. 
01:01 <shepazu> This snapshot method of landmark mapping that John Kirkwood describes is very efficient. It's how ants navigate visually
01:04 <fredesch> [edit] Are your accessibility  icons standardized/widely used?
01:04 <opyh> No, from what I know, the traffic light scheme with the 3 different shapes is so far only used on https://wheelmap.org and https://map.pfotenpiloten.org
01:05 <Helixopp> [edit] The SEO argument has been around for websites for a long time, without much success.
01:05 <opyh> Do you have data about this? I keep hearing that you should improve web a11y (e.g. use semantic HTML) to improve your search rank, but I don't know the specific algorithm impact
01:05 <shepazu> (Or airports when you're in a hurry to get to your next gate)
01:06 <prushforth> It's how I (used to) navigate road trips before Google maps
01:07 <Helixopp> [edit] Is this meant to supplement what hospitality providers are already doing, or replace it?
01:07 <opyh> The schema.org extension is supposed to extend what they are already doing. Together with the University of Innsbruck, the German board for tourism is working on this, too - it would go directly into https://schema.org/Hotel, for example (which is used by booking.com, for example)
01:08 <thehabes> Devs will understand those important data points from schemas and APIs.  That's what something standard needs to be out there for the web.
01:08 <prushforth> question for the panel: is there room for Web standards in serving the needs of COGA 
01:09 <Helixopp> [edit] Hotels mostly provide their a11y info
01:09 <opyh> Unfortunately not. The bad thing is that there is no open standard for by-room accessibility features. If a hotel is described as 'accessible with a wheelchair' this might mean a lot of things and in the worst case it's not actually accessible, but just provides an accessible toilet, for example, but they forgot to make enough space next to the bed (etc.)
01:09 <thehabes> [edit] Devs will understand those important data points from schemas and APIs.  That's whysomething standard needs to be out there for the web.  There's so much here I can't even concieve of head of time as dev with my ignorance of accessibility needs.  
01:09 <Helixopp> [edit] Hotels mostly provide their a11y info
01:09 <opyh> The current state is that as a disabled guest, you _always_ have to make a follow-up call after your booking
01:10 <Helixopp> [edit] Hotels mostly provide their a11y info
01:10 <opyh> Details are often just a PDF that is on a different webpage - nobody wants to scrape 100 PDFs after browsing 100 rooms, so we think this information needs to be a data standard so it's searchable (currently it isn't)
01:12 <opyh> Interesting discussion… So indoor mapping, on OSM for example, could add a tag for 'this object on the map is an important cue' so an assistant could use these?
01:13 <Helixopp> [edit] Hotels mostly provide their a11y info
01:13 <opyh> Here is an example of a search for specific accessibility criteria for Hotels: https://www.germany.travel/en/ms/barrier-free-travel/experience-barrier-free-travel-in-germany.html - this is what needs to be standardized, the organization behind this website is working on getting this into schema.org, too
01:14 <shepazu> Man, there's a lot of different accessibility material in this workshop!
01:14 <thehabes> [edit] Very nice presentation Sebastion, your thoughts are not entirely siloed.
01:14 <opyh> Thanks! :)
01:16 <opyh> The idea is we can start with an accessibility specific vocabulary to mix into the other vocabularies, and add the part where it makes sense directly into schema.org as it's the most popular standard
01:16 <thehabes> [edit] @prushforth  It's nice to see that a lot of people are using the syntax but struggling to fit their vocabulary in.  At least the right pieces are modularized.  Supporting all of us, or generally supporting Linked Data schema and context, means allowing MapML to take on context.  MapML can't possible pick and choose, but rather can support extension and, and standardized context inclusion, possibly through `<link
01:16 <thehabes> href="">`ing them in.  Like with how it links in coordinate systems, for example. 
01:16 <ghobona> [edit] Great presentation Sebastian!
01:16 <opyh> Thanks!

01:18 <AmeliaBR> [edit] 
01:18 <opyh> I have to say I was impressed by IMDF's documentation and attention to detail. And it has (some) accessibility additions already built-in. Here is the link: https://register.apple.com/resources/imdf/
01:19 <AmeliaBR> Topic: Advanced Analytics Software Project for Geospatial Data
01:20 <prushforth> @prushforth
01:20 <prushforth> Indoor accessibility mapping could be incorporated into city construction by-laws
01:20 <prushforth> Chris Little: Apple is proposing its indoor mapping system IMDF as a community standard in OGC now, and it will be open for public comment.

01:20 <prushforth> 
01:20 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:20 <shepazu> I know RDFa, but in this case, you're adding a lot of empty meta elements that inflates the DOM and bandwidth quite a lot, and isn't always a good authoring experience

01:26 <prushforth> [edit] 
01:26 <opyh> That's something we are working on too. Example case: We talked to a bigger city in Germany recently. The outcome: When they make a call for bid for new elevators they build, the call for bid will include that the elevator must have a live status API to connect it to navigation apps like Wheelmap. We hope this can be a showcase for creating such a law on a bigger scale (e.g. EU, in our case).

01:26 <thehabes> href="">`ing them in.  Like with how it links in coordinate systems, for example. 
01:26 <prushforth> Yes, <feature> is intended to be the least possible container for simple feature semantics, but we know how people will need to stretch the container to make it work.  My comment is mostly that I thought there was already an attribute-based encoding of semantics that would also apply to feature, both within <properties> as well as <geometry>.
01:26 <IvanSanchez_gitlab> machine-to-machine?
01:27 <satakagi> Maybe so
01:27 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:27 <opyh> Would you have a specific other preference how to add the data? JSON-LD with selector references to the `<feature>` elements, or something else?
01:27 <IvanSanchez_gitlab> [edit] I must say this: If this were an in-person session, I'd be frowning in my seat right now. There's an overload of buzzwords, and my brain cannot derive any useful content.

01:28 <ghobona> Great presentation Nicolas!
01:30 <AmeliaBR> From Chris Little in Zoom (he's firewalled out of gitter):
01:30 <AmeliaBR> W3C SDWIG/WG has an ethical use of Geo data work theme
01:30 <AmeliaBR> 
01:30 <AmeliaBR> Topic: Embedding rendering & behavior configuration in map data
01:30 <AmeliaBR> Speaker is Danielle Dupuy
01:31 <AmeliaBR> Slides (powerpoint): https://www.w3.org/2020/maps/supporting-material-uploads/presentations/Danielle_Dupuy_W3C-OGC_EmbeddingMapData.pptx
01:33 <Helixopp> [edit] For maps that identify accessible spaces: I've seen several of these from different providers around the world. Is there plans to standardize, share information, and collaborate to provide a fully functional global solution?
01:33 <opyh> If you want to participate in this process or know others that are interested, https://www.w3.org/community/lda/ and its mailing list is be a good place for coordinating all the related efforts
01:33 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:33 <shepazu> I wonder if maybe there should be a link to a data API instead, with the link marked with semantic indicators?
01:35 <prushforth> @opyh I echo the compliments on your presentation and I would love to see a <feature> based encoding of semantics that we could use to prove something useful for accessibility. It sounds like we should collaborate!
01:35 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:35 <shepazu> So, a UA could load it on demand, without needing to populate the DOM with empty elements, much less verbose and clearer to read and to author
01:36 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:36 <shepazu> that's just an idea, of course
01:37 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:37 <opyh> Good idea… pro: less data transferred as not every user agent needs it, con: you'd reveal to the server's that you probably have a disability
01:37 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:37 <opyh> The `sameAs` attribute would work for this.
01:37 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:37 <shepazu> but when you consider all the different types of data for different demographics that you might want to include, multiplied by all the different places to be marked, this might be a more efficient method that's just as full-featured and enabling
01:38 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:38 <opyh> Is there another standard that already does something similar, so we could use existing infrastructure for this? The idea about RDFa/microformats/JSON-LD was that there is already a lot of tooling around it
01:39 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:39 <shepazu> Regarding revealing your PII… they can already sniff that if they're interested… but you could actually have the link point to a different resource that doesn't track, out of band, and have a user preference in your UA that whitelists acceptable sources
01:40 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:40 <opyh> True. I think your idea is definitely good.
01:41 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:41 <opyh> Thanks for the input :)
01:41 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:41 <shepazu> RDFa works best when you're marking up existing text content elements, not populating blank meta elements
01:43 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:43 <shepazu> To be honest, I'm not sure if anyone's done exactly what I'm proposing, but I'd be happy to talk about it offlist… would be easy to prototype with a browser extension
01:43 <IvanSanchez_gitlab> Danielle's presentation kinda reminded me of an old experiment of mine, dubbed "spreadnik". Goal was to use spreadsheets to generate mapnik stylesheets (before all the work on graphical map style editors was made). Representing all the state for symbolizing features in a way that non-coders can change it is.... hard. That, or you make a hellscape of nested dialogs.

01:49 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work
01:49 <shepazu> That doesn't seem to describe what the endpoint provides
02:00 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work

02:02 <prushforth> [edit] @opyh I echo the compliments on your presentation and I would love to see a <feature> based encoding of semantics that we could use to prove something useful for accessibility. It sounds like we should collaborate!
02:02 <opyh> Thanks! Simply via issue in the MapML GitHub?
02:10 <ghobona> Great presentation Danielle!
02:10 <ghobona> Great presentation @chris-little!
02:11 <shepazu> [edit] yeah, I think the idea is good, but the syntax needs work

02:29 <AmeliaBR> question from Chris Little:
02:29 <AmeliaBR> But horizontal errors in WGS84 ellipsoid could be 10s of metre if not 100m. Why not use an Indian Ref Sys.?
