00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.990
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Hello everyone who's joined so far.

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.620
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I think we might wait a moment or two, just to make sure people

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.380
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Figured out the technology.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.530
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I wanted to confirm that our capture was all hooked up, and I see it's already working. So that's great.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.470
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: If you would like that somewhere near the bottom of the screen there should probably be a CC button.

6
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.970
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: It might be hidden in the three dots more menu and you'll get subtitles of what people are saying

7
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.130
In case.

8
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.050
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: You

9
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.160
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Have hard hearing or hard time with English or people's accents. Hopefully this will help

10
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.030
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: As I said all wait a couple more minutes and then we'll actually get started.

11
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.550
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Shall we begin

12
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.420
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So, welcome. Oh.

13
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.420
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Thank you for joining us, especially if this is an awkward time of day for you.

14
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:07.740
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: My name is Amelia Bellamy Royds I'm one of the members of the programming committee who has been organizing this workshop

15
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.150
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So welcome to what you are participating in is the W three see oh GC.

16
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.890
Get this title correctly.

17
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.160
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: W three C OTC workshop on maps for the web.

18
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.230
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Um,

19
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:42.510
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So our host organizations. The WCC the World Wide Web can search him.

20
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.940
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Works on standards for the web platform.

21
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.930
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The OTC the Open Geospatial Consortium works on standards for

22
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.690
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Geospatial data and mapping and

23
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.430
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Are

24
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.570
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: More specific hosts the maps for HTML community group which is a

25
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.210
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Open to

26
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.910
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Pretty much every one group of people interested in getting a

27
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:29.760
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Map presentation on the web more standardized and our host slash sponsor is Natural Resources Canada who have been

28
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.330
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Funding. A lot of this work and who are

29
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.760
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Paying for the captioning and a few other logistics related to the workshop

30
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:54.810
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So speaking of logistics. If you are here in person, then you have successfully join the zoom conference.

31
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:05.580
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: glad you made it here. If you are watching a archived video because you weren't able to join the zoom conference.

32
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:34.620
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: For reasons due to troublemakers jumping on zoom calls. We're not posting the live zoom links on the web. But if you registered for the conference in advance. You should have gotten an email from Ted guild that says something about workshop logistics in the title and it will have the

33
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.600
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Zoom link.

34
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.590
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: If you are registered and you

35
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:55.110
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Can't find that email, then do try to reach out to the programming committee members their email addresses on the website and we will try and get you connected up for the rest of the workshop

36
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.820
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I'm

37
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.880
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Related to that, if you can't participate in the live sessions.

38
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:21.570
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: They are going to be all different times of the day and we know they aren't convenient for everyone. We will be recording all the sessions and trying to post them online within a day or two, so you can catch up by watching the recording.

39
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.770
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And

40
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:43.230
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The recordings will be hosted on the WCC YouTube channel. The discussion will continue on the W IC G discourse server.

41
00:07:46.290 --> 00:08:04.320
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And we'll have kind of open forum on each topic where people can add comments add more examples really go in more depth than we can on videoconference situation.

42
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:14.100
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: There is also a live chat on get her that we've set up. So that's just

43
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.530
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: more casual conversation as we go along.

44
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.710
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: It's where we'll be sharing links and such as we go.

45
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:38.040
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And just during the course of the workshop. It's a way to ask questions of other participants or any logistical issues that come up

46
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.040
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And if you're not familiar with get her. It's just a

47
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.580
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: chat application.

48
00:08:48.930 --> 00:09:05.430
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: single column chat room, you can log in with a GitHub account with a Twitter account. I think you might be able to make an account directly on the site, but hopefully most participants have at least one of those ways to login

49
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.770
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And finally, a note there is a chat built into the zoom interface.

50
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:26.310
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: We're going to try and keep that to zoom specific comments. If there are technical difficulties. If you can't hear someone if you can't see their screen share you can

51
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.980
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Put it in the zoom chat, but

52
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:39.960
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The Gator and discourse will be kind of the more lasting chat that persist even after we close down the telecom

53
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:54.990
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I'm one final important thing to mention this is a professional event we are operating under the W three C's code of conduct, we expect

54
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:13.380
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Respectful treatment of everyone. If you have any concerns about that if you want to read the full code of content is linked from the Web site.

55
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:25.260
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Somebody could even put a link into the chat so you can show that the chat works and if you do have any concerns about

56
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:37.680
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Any of the content in the of the behavior of other participants, you can reach out to the programming committee members or the W three see on boots office.

57
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.370
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And I think that was all my

58
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.210
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Logistics and introduction home I took 10 minutes

59
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.210
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So with

60
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:59.190
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: That all out of the way, I'd like to introduce our first speaker of the workshop

61
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.590
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Peter Rushforth

62
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.050
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Is a

63
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:31.140
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Geologist in GIS expert who now works at National Resources Canada with a specific focus on standardization for geospatial information and maps and he's been one of the most persistent driving forces behind the maps for HTML project.

64
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.370
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: He is going to be talking to us today, kind of as a

65
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:52.320
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Big intro introduction to the whole purpose of the workshop why maps for the web are worth talking about are worth standardizing are worth getting excited about.

66
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.880
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay, Peter, are you ready to go.

104
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.950
Peter Rushforth: Good evening, and good morning. My name is Peter rush forth, and I work for natural resources, Canada's

105
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.580
Peter Rushforth: Center from

106
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.230
Earth observation in the Canadian geospatial data infrastructure division.

107
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:18.700
Today I want to talk about why we need to standardize maps for the web in HTML.

108
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:36.340
There are many reasons that people need or want to make web maps in the domain in which I work, it's a requirement of most projects. But how do you make a Web Map. It's easy right there are lots of ways to make a Web Map. You just need to pick a framework.

109
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:47.830
Each framework has its merits. Some are easy to get started with some come with a bunch of free lit data layers built right in.

110
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:59.650
Others require significant knowledge and or manipulation of data and access to computing resources accessibility is not guaranteed and it's easy to mess it up.

111
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:08.680
Interoperability pretty much does not exist. In short, there is no simplest choice and it can be a big decision.

112
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:20.770
Once you decide, all the code that you write does belong to you, except it's bound to the framework, you've chosen making any change expensive and painful, the result.

113
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:37.090
The result is silos. Although each web mapping framework is somewhat similar known share the same foundation and they are not interoperable, except in that the user can see a map. The result is bad for users and the web.

114
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.960
Why do silos exist.

115
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:56.800
So I know this might be caused by a proprietary interest, such as those created to lock users into software platforms, but more likely they exist because we didn't take the trouble to collaborate and eliminate the barriers or or to create interoperability.

116
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:15.940
Proposal. We'd like to make in this workshop is, why don't we work together to support all the users mapping framework providers are all trying to serve their users collectively collectively, the sum of their users is approximately equivalent to humanity as a whole.

117
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:27.070
All the map providers use the web as their medium of choice to deliver their products together let's improve the web to serve all of the providers equally well

118
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:38.770
Possibly reducing their individual frameworks responsibilities. Let's make a standard that helps with the common core that these providers can progressively enhance if need be.

119
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:59.800
Let's make a standard to serve users needs directly through common accessibility privacy safety linguistic and usability infrastructure, just as we try to do for users in the real world with roads, bridges, sidewalks crosswalks science, etc. While we're at it.

120
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:14.590
Let's make the standard and natural first step in learning so that maps can be taught at school, giving children a common starting point for learning about geography and the web without frameworks.

121
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:34.960
Can silos truly disappear. Though the test of independent invention first described by Tim burners Lee is a kind of thought experiment. The notion is that any new protocol or format must be designed for introduction into an environment that has incumbents or it cannot succeed.

122
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:43.480
At the invention of the web for example FTP gopher waste all existed in the mainstream already

123
00:15:44.530 --> 00:16:01.990
HTTP, HTML and URLs were designed to work with the existing protocols somewhat satisfying the test of in independent invention, which can never be perfectly resolved, you can't make silos disappear. But over time, they can resolve on their own.

124
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:11.380
In the real world, infrastructure, often describes public facilities created for the benefit of all without prejudice.

125
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:24.280
Such infrastructure must be safe and accessible safe for everyone to use it must be fair and inclusive. What good would roads and bridges be if you could only drive a Ford on them.

126
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:34.330
It must be durable, because everybody uses it infrastructure must be built to serve. And last, and finally, it must be cost effective.

127
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:47.680
Infrastructure should make it less costly for everyone to achieve their goals knows that that that this does not mean that it's free. In fact, it can be quite costly, but it should be maximally shareable

128
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:59.320
In the virtual world, the world wide web, and the software that supports it is virtual but nonetheless real infrastructure.

129
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:15.490
But how do we avoid creating more silos in standardizing maps and spatial data for the web. The situation in web mapping Stan standards is a little bit like this x case CD comic

130
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:32.020
There are probably more than 14 different ways to create a Web Map and trying to make the situation better by adding another framework risks creating a worse situation. So what to do. Can we fix the situation by adding another standard, probably not.

131
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:41.860
Many existing formats for to geospatial information already exist if one of them was suitable it probably would be a web standard

132
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:51.670
The challenge is to create a new format that enables web maps without requiring web browsers to radically change or change their architecture which is impossible.

133
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.270
proposed solution is to add and extend mapping elements in HTML.

134
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:06.040
HTML is widespread and it's the foundation of web architecture and browsers are based on processing it

135
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.320
The bonuses that HTML already implements basic map semantics.

136
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:20.770
HTML. Pictured here is the core language of the web and it was designed to bridge the divide between programmers and users.

137
00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:40.060
Ideally it allows everyone to have access to content regardless of ability. Further, it is straightforward enough to allow users to to become authors. This is embodied in the idea of view source culture in which the medium itself teaches the user what is possible and how to achieve it.

138
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:57.340
Why are maps in HTML preferred over maps in JavaScript in the future because HTML requires and delivers interoperability, the browser will become a spatial integration platform shared standardized semantics mean interoperability.

139
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:12.250
Discovery because of the rule of least for power web pages could have location indexing pages by location search engines will become spatial discovery platforms.

140
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:26.980
HTML requires and delivers inclusive pretty understandable and created by created by browser authors who are not necessarily programmers or authors who are not necessarily matters for that matter.

141
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:48.550
HTML requires and delivers accessibility because things, not just web pages of location, the browser will tell the user about their physical environment, as described by a Web Map or website for public spaces real infrastructure will be represented also as virtual infrastructure.

142
00:19:50.770 --> 00:20:02.230
HTML requires and delivers performance less runtime costs to HTML into JavaScript mean map rendering is better and more suitable for native code.

143
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:13.420
HTML requires and delivers scalability related to performance and inclusive city and possibly other aspects of this list.

144
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:19.810
Scalability means maps will work in constrained or powerful environments.

145
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:31.840
HTML is like the standard library of the web, a single element encapsulates processing steps, especially rendering from the layers below.

146
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:42.160
Maps and location belong in the web's standard library so that sophisticated applications can be built on top of the web, without having to reinvent the wheel.

147
00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:53.200
HTML is simple enough for a web crawler to understand but scales to underlie very sophisticated application development, even though

148
00:20:53.890 --> 00:21:01.420
modern web crawlers can execute web applications to reveal the application generated HTML and text content.

149
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:16.930
They can't understand semantics that aren't there, such as maps and location which don't exist yet in HTML standardized location is important not only for search and discovery, but also for accessibility and internationalization.

150
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:28.060
Peter Rushforth: A key aspect of HTML is that it is standard its elements have defined visual and accessibility semantics, making it inherently inclusive.

151
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:34.540
Peter Rushforth: Adding maps to HTML could aid important use cases for users, such as search and discovery.

152
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:48.760
Peter Rushforth: Reducing the need for special purpose catalogs and the same link ability or web superpower that allows crawlers to enable search and discovery will also enable Map Service Federation and location information sharing

153
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:56.530
Peter Rushforth: HTML is inherently cross platform, making it the ideal target for standardizing location information.

154
00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:07.360
Peter Rushforth: These aspects, taken together mean that maps in HTML will be more economically effective than our current silos, leading to better return on investments for society.

155
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:14.620
Peter Rushforth: Is Tim and I was a massive decade long effort and there's little appetite in the web standards community to repeat such an effort

156
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:25.750
Peter Rushforth: HTML does however constantly change and today the HTML standard itself is evergreen with new ideas being integrated and browsers implementing constantly

157
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:37.330
Peter Rushforth: So how does the process work ideally developers like us who use JavaScript, HTML and CSS provide feedback to the web platform engineers.

158
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:50.050
Peter Rushforth: Who prioritize implementing low level features that are views to the largest number of people often these features are of JavaScript, but also of CSS and HTML.

159
00:22:51.070 --> 00:23:00.310
As low level features are implemented the thinking goes developers will hot will develop high level features as libraries or custom elements.

160
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:09.040
As the high level functionality that browser that becomes widely used, it just becomes an emergent or de facto standard

161
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:27.220
These de facto standards can then be implemented natively by browser developers, giving rise to wider and improved use of the web and consequent generation of new requirements from new communities like our own participating in the virtuous cycle and so on.

162
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:42.610
That maps are an emergent characteristic of the web even constituting a geo web is obvious to the most casual observer.

163
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:52.600
Maps in the HTML of the future might look like this, starting with a map element containing one or more child layer elements.

164
00:23:53.290 --> 00:24:03.970
There already exists as somewhat neglected map element in HTML with similar enough semantics to provide a good extension point in keeping with the HTML design principles.

165
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:18.760
by specifying a new child layer element HTML could immediately incorporate dynamic Web Map semantics as commonly understood providing the shareable infrastructure that web maps and geospatial information require

166
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:32.860
HTML has evolved over time. It began as simple as simple text documents linked together. It was the linking that made them special linking has been described as the web superpower.

167
00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:45.100
Overtime media types have been added in response to user needs. And most recently, with the advent of the mobile web and responsive design not should be the next big thing.

168
00:24:46.570 --> 00:25:00.430
So we're actually is this virtuous feedback loop of which I spoke the maps for HTML community group was created based on the conviction that web mapping is an emergent or de facto standard of the web.

169
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:18.160
As sought by the extensible web manifesto. The main way to provide feedback to the browser standards community is for you, especially representing your organization or company to join them apps for HTML community group to contribute ideas comments and even code.

170
00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:35.380
Another important path for feedback from web mapping community to the web platform, folks, is the annual Mozilla web developer needs assessment or web DNA survey, please share the link mentioned web mapping mentioned maps in HTML.

171
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:48.190
A key feature of the URL driven web of HTML is the ability to share documents using their URL. This feature of the web.

172
00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:06.550
also enables linking within and between resources, not to mention search and discovery, the simple architectural characteristic could make web map a geo web of the future, a benefit to users around the globe and to the interests that rely on it. In other words, everyone.

173
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.810
HTML will provide a common foundation for maps and location for all stakeholders.

174
00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:22.180
spatial information is infrastructure and a standard that represents is common foundation will unlock the true value of that infrastructure.

175
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:36.490
Maps standardized in HTML will allow us to encode and share our understanding of the world. Let's achieve the understanding of our physical world by enabling the representation of that world in HTML together.

176
00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:39.490
Thank you.

177
00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.040
Peter Rushforth: Hello.

178
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.290
Peter Rushforth: I'm done is that

179
00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.120
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay. Thank you, Peter.

180
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.600
Peter Rushforth: Thank you.

181
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:11.950
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay, I think, in future, we'll probably have breaks between themes. But since today is a short day I might just jump right ahead.

182
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:19.570
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So,

183
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.690
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Next talk of the day is by Amelia Bellamy right that's me.

184
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.770
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So before I got

185
00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:38.350
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Distracted into organizing a workshop

186
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.260
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: My first

187
00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.870
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Task working

188
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:49.420
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: With the mouse for HTML community group was to really

189
00:27:52.060 --> 00:28:14.290
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Assess the project that Peter and others in the geospatial community had done and focus on ways it can move forward within the web standards world. I've been working within web standards for a few years now, primarily

190
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:25.810
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: SVG vector graphic CSS also accessibility as it relates to those two topics and

191
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:33.010
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Found the potential of web standards and also some of the

192
00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.480
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Limitations. We can't just

193
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:57.070
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Add everything and anything to the web because the web platform is implemented in multiple environments that need to run on all sorts of devices and

194
00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:09.280
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: It's not unlimited what these devices can do. We can't just keep adding code and whatever we do add pretty much has to

195
00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:30.250
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Stick indefinitely or at least that's the goal of web standardization that once we have websites that are out there and that were web browsers. Try to support those going forward as much as possible. So we, there's a lot of

196
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:38.260
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Caution in the web standards world about adding new features to make sure that those features.

197
00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.850
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Are the right ones and are designed correctly.

198
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.540
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So,

199
00:29:52.120 --> 00:30:01.990
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: One of the most important mental frameworks that is currently adopted by web standards, folks, is this idea

200
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:15.520
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Of an extensible web that the best thing the web platform can do is to create tools from which website authors and web application developers.

201
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:29.410
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Can build the features they want and test them out and get the right shape of the features as the website authors like them. And as website users like them.

202
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:40.870
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: With the end goal, at least in theory that by demonstrating that there is a demand for a certain feature in a certain design then

203
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:56.800
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: They can bring that to the web standardization process and say this is a tested idea. This is a proven design pattern there is clear demand for it. Let scattered in standards so

204
00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.240
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Now I'm coming from with

205
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.920
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The maps for HTML project. My first task was to

206
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:22.960
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Look at what maps are already on the web. And there are maps on the web. There have been maps on the web, since the

207
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.860
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Very beginning

208
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:37.390
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Of well almost the beginning. Ever since there's been images on the web. There have been maps on the web. There have been

209
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:54.670
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Pictures of maps the same way in a printed textbook, you have a picture of a map and shortly after that there was the first interactive maps using the map element that Peter mentioned briefly.

210
00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:16.570
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The map element as it currently exists in HTML isn't specifically about geographic maps, but it can be used for it and you'll see on my screen. I have a image map that is on one of the websites I use every day. The weather forecast in Canada and

211
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:28.270
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: It's just a simple picture that they generate on their web server have a map of Canada with icons and text baked in.

212
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:42.700
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: But then there are different links to different forecast and you can click through and find out that here where I am in Edmonton, it's currently 14 degrees Celsius on a Sunday evening.

213
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:59.650
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Now this has nice features, it's supported widely in most browsers. It's even accessible to keyboard, although I discovered when I was

214
00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:23.380
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Playing with it earlier, that it's no longer fully accessible in Chrome, because I tapping through these links in the picture and you can't tell where I'm tapping. So even browser is bake break accessibility now and then. And that's not a great thing, but

215
00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:41.050
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The good thing about it is, once they fix this bug every image map will get fixed on the browser, because the browser actually knows what it's looking at it knows that these are links, it knows that the links have a certain shape.

216
00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:56.110
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And so there is some semantic information there. But this is really all the browser knows about a map is a picture with certain regions of that picture, having links on them that isn't

217
00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:11.410
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The map as we think about web maps today. So the current conception of a Web Map probably looks something more like this. Here's a Google Maps embed

218
00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:34.840
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And it's zoomed in to Edmonton, but I can zoom out. So you can see all of North America, I can pan over to Europe, I can do lots of things. And I could also have links on this, but it's interactive it's

219
00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:45.820
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Not just a single image, it's a complex data model behind what the map is so

220
00:34:47.350 --> 00:35:02.710
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: This is really the very simplest modern conception of a Web Map is something which we can work with and the user can find the information that they need within it.

221
00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:08.230
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So,

222
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:10.270
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: From that

223
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:26.710
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: We go into this idea of what are the use cases and requirements for web maps, if we actually define what are those features that make what we now consider to be a Web Map.

224
00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:51.640
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Um, and because I'm working from this extensible web model of looking at what website developers and users have already come to expect the approach taken for this report, which is still incomplete draft and we welcome your contributions, is we're going to be looking at

225
00:35:53.830 --> 00:36:06.370
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: It existing implementations of web maps and what are the common features that they have, what are the use cases they serve. And also, what are the limitations.

226
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:21.940
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Because of course, if the existing web maps solve all the use cases, then we don't need to change anything. We don't need any new standards, but there are limitations that come from the fact that

227
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:42.700
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: These maps are being rendered using a lot of code that needs to be downloaded and every website and the final representation doesn't have a semantic meaning that the browser can understand and build on and adapt.

228
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.060
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So the specific

229
00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:57.460
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Exam examples, we're looking at, and we can maybe add more these but they get a lot. So we're looking at two types. The

230
00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:09.220
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Sort of more declarative approach that's currently available on the web are anybody can go to one of these major mapping services, create a map in the

231
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:26.260
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: User Interface visual or user interface that looks good and get an embed code which they can copy somewhere else. So that's the easy to use for a website author content creator who might not be an expert in web mapping

232
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:38.860
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Excuse me. And then the other type of web maps, we're looking at are the JavaScript frameworks which are

233
00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:45.910
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Require a little more expertise for the website author to code them up and

234
00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:59.680
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Run the code on their site that builds the map dynamically, but they're a lot more flexible for website developers who want to add their own features or their own content.

235
00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:14.230
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So this page is one of the many pages of examples for building for the report, just so we can look at how these different existing tools.

236
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:29.410
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Implement the features. So this is the very minimum basic combat that comes up. What do you get when you just say put them up on this web page on some cases it's very plain don't labels.

237
00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:34.300
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Have a more content in the initial

238
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:50.290
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And we've for the scripted ones we've got the examples of how much code you need to include in order to get that map on your web page, which of course goes to the accessibility for

239
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.750
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Website authors.

240
00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:16.480
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Not gets me to a question when we're talking about use cases, it's worth thinking about use cases for whom, who are we thinking of using these web mapping tools. So within the report, we're looking at three main groups.

241
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:18.880
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Or against

242
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:40.780
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Three main groups, the content author who's creating a website or creating content for a website or a blog or something on the web and they just want to add a map to their blog post to their article to their Web Store.

243
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:53.710
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: They're not geospatial experts, they're not necessarily programming experts. They want the map for the content, it presents and so

244
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.830
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: What type of content. What are the basic types of maps.

245
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.950
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Simple

246
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:11.800
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Point on a map for this is where my restaurant is located. This is where my store is located.

247
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:20.500
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: More complex data or more complex imagery it

248
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:38.950
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Builds up depending on where they are. So some of the slightly more complex examples, we're looking at our have a pop up next to the marker. So there's a marker on the map, but you want extra information, a little bit of HTML. So

249
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:45.790
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: We've got an example of the different ways you can do that in different

250
00:40:46.960 --> 00:41:12.490
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Libraries and the amount of code that it takes to do that. So leaflet has a very built in method of how to create a pop up and you get a lot out of the box from a couple lines of authoring code and you get event handling for opening and closing and it positions and you can

251
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:15.100
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Zoom out.

252
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.550
And it still works.

253
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:32.260
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So there's a lot of behavior there other libraries takes a little more manual code to get the same behavior that's the open layers code for the demo. And so

254
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:47.500
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The website author to get this particular same behavior of a pop up from a marker point needs little more work. So those are the kinds of things we're looking at use cases.

255
00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:57.400
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Not only what you're doing. But how much work it takes far as writing code to make that happen.

256
00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:14.860
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Some other quick examples of content author use cases highlighting a region, rather than just a marker point. So for this example, we're using geo JSON as the data format for describing that polygon.

257
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:27.550
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And how easy is it to get that custom geo JSON shape into our map so that it lines up and can be styled custom

258
00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.910
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Sorry soon popping up and blocking my

259
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:41.620
Screen.

260
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.310
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Go over there. Okay.

261
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:52.240
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Then another use case is actually not mapping at all. This is

262
00:42:53.350 --> 00:43:03.100
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Not a map. It's a painting, but it's a painting rendered within the mapping applications. This is leaflet JS, not with Open Street Map tiles.

263
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:14.950
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: But the reason you might want to have a painting in a mapping application is so that you can use the tiling with zoom effect.

264
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:29.020
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Where as you zoom in you load. Additional images with higher resolution instead of loading a giant file at the beginning. So this is an important

265
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:49.120
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Aspect that we're considering within our use cases report is how can the mapping tools and the features that are necessary for a good web maps. How can they also be used for other things that people want to do within the web platform.

266
00:43:50.230 --> 00:44:06.190
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And if we can find these connections find these additional use cases for the primitives, then we find more people who are interested in getting these features standardized and

267
00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:25.150
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Working to. Now I said a little content author the website owner is only one target ever use cases is the next one is our website visitor. So is someone going to a

268
00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:34.360
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Website have things that I want to do with a map that maybe the website owner didn't think about so

269
00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:36.970
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I'm

270
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:48.550
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Maybe the website on it didn't think about accessibility and the fact that I need to use my keyboard to tab through things. And I'd like to see what's currently focused

271
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.780
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Maybe the

272
00:44:54.250 --> 00:45:08.350
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: website owner didn't think about the fact that I'm going to need to print out that map or I'm going to need to export an address in a form that I can use in my GPS somehow

273
00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:18.190
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: There are lots of use cases that are from that end user perspective that are separate from

274
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.230
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The

275
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.930
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Desires or plans of the person who actually created the website.

276
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:42.100
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And I'm not going to get too much detail here. We've actually got a another talk later in the week Nick Chan will be talking about her assessment for this report on some of the interaction patterns in the

277
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:55.000
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Various web mapping tools and what that relates to the accessibility of the web maps for people who use the web in various ways.

278
00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:16.780
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So moving on to our third category of use cases. That's your application developer. So this is again a website creator, but someone who's interested in maps in a more complicated level interested in adding new features, because

279
00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:26.470
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: There is so much that could be done with maps on the web. And we're never going to have those all built into a standard tool.

280
00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:38.290
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: There are always going to be custom use cases. In addition, so for the application developer who wants to build additional geospatial features.

281
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:46.930
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The use cases are about how much they can extend and build on the

282
00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.210
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Standard tool.

283
00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:55.420
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Without having to recreate all the basic features from scratch.

284
00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:08.470
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So one of our use case examples we've got is add a extra control that does something so trying to keep it simple so

285
00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:23.230
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Was our contributor Nick Fitzsimmons who added this one. So this is the feature it describes where the math is centered as we move it shows

286
00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:39.310
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: A different latitude and longitude and I can mark the current lot a tude and launch it at the center of it and I can pan away, and then I hit another button and it returns back so

287
00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:46.570
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Simple functionality, but actually there is a lot going on here.

288
00:47:47.710 --> 00:48:07.360
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Updating when I pan the map and it's changing the position of the marker and then it's changing the position of the map on a different button and it's responding to the button clicks, as well as the movement of the map itself and so

289
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:18.970
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: We've got lots of different interaction patterns between what the user is doing what the

290
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:31.810
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Web Map library code is doing. And then what the custom JavaScript is doing. And again, we've got this implemented in many different libraries with

291
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:39.670
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Similar behavior we can mark the center pan away, return back

292
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.750
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Again, differing amounts of code, depending on how well

293
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.900
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Optimized

294
00:48:51.010 --> 00:49:00.430
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The library is for these particular things we're trying to do, although at this point. Pretty much all of them. There's a lot of custom code because that's what we're doing. We're extending the map.

295
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:28.930
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So within all these use cases. As I said, there are a lot of little pieces that need to go together. So we're calling those the individual capabilities. So these are the low level features that need to be available in order for you to build up the full use case.

296
00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:48.340
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And within of the each of these capabilities were then looking at is it implemented in existing tools is implemented in a consistent way where we can say there is a clear pattern of be

297
00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:58.990
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Implementation that this is how the standards should be designed, because this is how users or developers expect it to be designed

298
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:07.630
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: We're looking at, are there any connections to existing web standards that could be

299
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:28.210
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: reused in a pattern that's consistent with the web or their proposals that are for other web features that we could connect up and are their use cases for this low level feature that is use cases beyond so

300
00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:42.280
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I've already shown the example of wanting to be able to zoom in and adjust resolution on non that content more generally just having pan and zoom as

301
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:56.860
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: It's a really complex interaction. There's different ways of panning and zooming depending on using mouse or keyboard gestures and there are lots of stuff on the web that use pan and zoom

302
00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:15.400
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Zooming in on a product photo on a store that's not a map related, but there are similarities. And so if we had these low level features and sort of browser awareness of what pan and zoom is it could be used in multiple places.

303
00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.170
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The idea of having a pop up tool tip.

304
00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:27.670
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Sort of or an info box that pops up that something that happens in lots of user interfaces.

305
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:37.570
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: But we don't have a built in way to position, things that are pop this up next to

306
00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:47.500
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Some other anchored thing but don't let it go off the edge of the screen or don't let it obscure something else that's

307
00:51:48.280 --> 00:52:03.790
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Anybody who's done a website coded that by hand those. There's a lot of things you have to think about to get right. If there was a built in primitive feature in the web for positioning a pop up where the browser.

308
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:12.640
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Can do it once and do it right for every website instead of every website author having to do is to write that code again.

309
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:16.420
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: There are lots of use cases for that beyond mapping

310
00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:40.780
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: But that said, there are lots of things that are needed for maps that are map specific you need maps need to understand latitude and longitude. They need to understand how that gets sent to different projections and coordinate systems.

311
00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:48.460
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And

312
00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.460
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Beyond this,

313
00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:13.720
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: basic primitives within all the little parts that you need for a map. There is definitely once you have those there's a benefit of having the integrated features the very convenient declarative features so that the

314
00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:30.490
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: restaurant owner who just wants to put a map on their website with a pointer to the restaurant doesn't have to think of all the little parts that go into making them up. They can just say, here's the location. Draw me the map.

315
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:33.310
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So,

316
00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:39.280
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: That's a brief overview of the project. One thing that

317
00:53:40.870 --> 00:54:00.430
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Has been very clear working on this project is just how many detailed creatures. There are once you start trying to list them all within the standard maps. So we are still working on the report we are welcoming contributors to the report, it's all on

318
00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:04.090
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: GitHub.

319
00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:06.220
And

320
00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:09.760
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: We've got

321
00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:18.100
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Sort of issue discussion pages for every section of the report that are linked back from

322
00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:28.120
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Sorry link back from each section about

323
00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:45.460
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Let's discuss what should we mentioned a year. What should we conclude about, is this an essential feature of a Web Map. Is this a nice to have feature of a Web Map, is this okay this is never going to happen in the browser feature.

324
00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:56.710
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And we're going to have all of those. But we definitely welcome your contributions and I've gone follow for 15 minutes. So I'm going to wrap this up now.

325
00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.990
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And go back to my hosting duties.

326
00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:17.800
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Final talk of the day is by Dan duck little who has been building maps on the web for many years since 2004

327
00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:21.640
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: When JavaScript was still

328
00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:36.130
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: New and wild so geo moose is built using XML and Dan will be telling us about some of the lessons learned from that project and

329
00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:41.350
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Take it away. Hopefully we can hear you.

330
00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:45.040
Duck Little: Oh, thank you. Am I getting through a little bit here.

331
00:55:45.700 --> 00:56:00.010
Duck Little: Okay, fantastic. So this is going to be a little bit different. I'm going to be covering something that's maybe a little bit more in the style of a retrospective on a project that's been around for a while.

332
00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.460
Duck Little: Which uses

333
00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:10.930
Duck Little: Which is playing on the tune instead of HTML. We've used XML.

334
00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:25.930
Duck Little: I can be found all over the internet with the handle the ducky little if anyone wants to have some follow up conversation, but do moose, or any of the controversial things I may or may not end up saying today a

335
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:33.100
Duck Little: Little bit of background on the project itself. It's actually an OS geo project.

336
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:42.310
Duck Little: It do moose is a web client that started with a co worker and myself at the city of St. Paul in Minnesota in the US.

337
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:55.120
Duck Little: The first release was back in, oh four and our big kind of coming out party was at the 2005 Map Server user group meeting for folks who are maybe not into

338
00:56:56.020 --> 00:57:11.500
Duck Little: Open Source GIS software. History The Map Server user groups were the precursor to the foster G conference. So this is how, like, I started feeling old knowing that we were presenting at conferences that were the precursor to phosphor Jade.

339
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:31.180
Duck Little: And we've done some cool stuff. Amelia mentioned that we use XML. And yes, we use XML and a healthy dose of JavaScript as much of it as we've been able to squeak through the browser through the years, but to do some really cool things such as describing pop ups.

340
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:40.390
Duck Little: providing detailed measure tools in the browser. That seems to be the like one of the next logical steps as soon as you can put a map in it, can I measure it.

341
00:57:41.890 --> 00:58:00.700
Duck Little: And a lot of health, a lot of having support for GC services through the years, including WF s t supports doing editing on the web and also adopting sort of web friendly technologies as they come through such as, you know, the early GL geo JSON and matte box vector tiles.

342
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:07.480
Duck Little: But I'm going to put us in the Wayback Machine and talk about the web of

343
00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:11.260
Duck Little: It was a different place.

344
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.260
Duck Little: There was a lot of

345
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:27.550
Duck Little: Things going on that were really innovative, but people were still trying to figure it out for us as a GIS project one of our big first goals was to talk to Map Server.

346
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:39.340
Duck Little: So I mentioned that we come out of Minnesota and folks may remember that Map Server used to be called Minnesota Map Server or the University of Minnesota Map Server and

347
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:50.230
Duck Little: My coworker James clustering, and I did actually work with Steve L'chaim on early Map Server code and it was sort of the de facto standard for how you render

348
00:58:50.920 --> 00:59:02.530
Duck Little: A complex map for the web. And because it's 2003 we wanted to use all of the cool features of the latest and greatest browser at the time, IE six

349
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:14.560
Duck Little: There might be a few of you on this call, or, you know, kind of curse at on a regular basis. The, the word Internet Explorer, but it was our best deploy platform at the time.

350
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:24.670
Duck Little: Now, those two things were both pretty normal. Actually, there are other people working in the space that we that really have those two goals in mind.

351
00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:45.160
Duck Little: What made you most unique was that we were dealing with a data for for large municipality that had multiple departments that were trying to inventory lots and lots of different assets and that meant we had hundreds of different data layers that were being digitized and produced

352
00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:56.770
Duck Little: So this was sort of Genesis. You'll notice that there isn't hundreds of layers here but it deals with

353
00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:03.100
Duck Little: Trying to describe different layers and catalog. It has basic map controls.

354
01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:22.540
Duck Little: This was what a modern web application, including occasionally the broken images senior looked like circa 2003. But this is sort of what we started with. And one of our first keys was the fact that we can describe these layers and controls actually using XML.

355
01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:27.310
Duck Little: So,

356
01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:44.560
Duck Little: We put all of this together and created an XML catalog. Because really we looked at the various pieces that we had and that we need to assemble some app servers configured using a format called map file. You can think of that is like a styling file for an for for a shape file.

357
01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:55.030
Duck Little: Because that's also what would have been popular circa 2000 307 and we had a lot of people contributing so XML was really, really.

358
01:00:55.930 --> 01:01:07.810
Duck Little: Unique for us and having a very basic markup was necessary for us because we needed to be able to describe you know how to organize all of these individual smaller pieces of work.

359
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:20.920
Duck Little: So what juice became was a really, really fancy access Lt. So that took the XML and translated to HTML, which then also had a giant JavaScript file next to it to render it

360
01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:30.880
Duck Little: So I'm very sympathetic to the idea of we need to make the browser do more of this work. I really would have been sympathetic and oh yeah during this development time to

361
01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:51.130
Duck Little: And because nothing's more fun than a code snippet, we can take a look at what this actually turned into. You can see that we described a map book. If you've ever looked at Old School maps, particularly atlases, those were referred to frequently as a map book generically.

362
01:01:52.450 --> 01:02:01.030
Duck Little: Because you had a book with multiple pages of different maps. So we created a map book XML format.

363
01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:19.300
Duck Little: And it had the ability to organize things hierarchically, so we call it the catalog was part of the map book each layer got a label and a description to its source file and whether it was on or off could also be grouped because again we're dealing with hundreds of different layers.

364
01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:30.370
Duck Little: And this is what we got you from that Genesis moment to this and you can see a lot of interesting components that are going on here.

365
01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:40.210
Duck Little: As the maps evolved. There was a lot of things that were necessary. We're also trying to convert people from using dedicated AutoCAD licenses for viewing maps so

366
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:50.470
Duck Little: If this looks more like a cat application than we achieved our goal at the time, but you can see in the catalog. Many, many layers very well organized

367
01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.870
Duck Little: rudimentary controls for navigation were available and

368
01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:02.560
Duck Little: This entire user interface was described using XML.

369
01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:07.390
Duck Little: And then we made it pretty

370
01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.190
Duck Little: Um, one of the cool things that we were able to do is because

371
01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:19.900
Duck Little: At the time the FTC was offering grants that allowed for cross community collaborations.

372
01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:28.240
Duck Little: To share data. Well, having data defined as an XML format made it easy for us to interchange with other cities and counties.

373
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:39.520
Duck Little: And so we were able to access some of that funding to develop the application some more and refined the XML format a bit more so that we could exchange these formats and the applications with different counties.

374
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:48.550
Duck Little: At one point, nearly every county in Minnesota had a moose website because and quite a few in North Dakota and other neighboring

375
01:03:49.390 --> 01:04:00.220
Duck Little: US states. In fact, we keep finding juice installations all across the world because people were able to really dig into the idea that you could describe a map using XML.

376
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:13.450
Duck Little: And whoa, it was good things were really fast to render even on you know hardware that would have come with it six as the upgrade browser, it still ran really fast.

377
01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:21.220
Duck Little: And just like we were talking about HTML earlier being really great for editors and that that sort of source driven

378
01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:32.890
Duck Little: epiphany that you can have by looking at the site and looking at the source we had that by being able to directly map in the definition of the way or an XML to what they would see in the user interface.

379
01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.900
Duck Little: some drawbacks to this.

380
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:48.010
Duck Little: One of the big ones was that the order in the catalog. So how do you define that XML structure was how it was seen in the map.

381
01:04:48.520 --> 01:05:02.860
Duck Little: So if for some reason somebody put an aerial photography layer at the top of their catalog because they wanted users to see it. It would also end up being the layer that was had the top of their map obscuring the entire view.

382
01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:13.720
Duck Little: There was also because we had targeted Map Server and event and then evolve that to WNs there wasn't really good ways of

383
01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:23.860
Duck Little: targeting different types of data sources as much as you can come up with a way for defining how to describe that there's a data source there.

384
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:31.270
Duck Little: The data sources are always going to be varied and that's continued to grow through the web at even though there are standard ways of doing it.

385
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:51.700
Duck Little: The other issue. We had this was an implementation detail is that every layer created an image tag really really cool because again, Ajax wasn't a thing. But then we started doing tiled maps. It broke, it broke it was making hundreds of requests in a second.

386
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.960
Duck Little: So we started the next version of the project.

387
01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:07.060
Duck Little: Because you moose was built using a custom mapping library we were sort of the 15th standard that x Casey refers to whereas

388
01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:16.270
Duck Little: And the reason for that was because open layers itself wasn't functional enough for us to switch over, but around 2007 it did.

389
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:24.250
Duck Little: It also had much better cross browser support because, well, you know, seven. You could still basically target IE and run everywhere.

390
01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:30.970
Duck Little: And we also work with later versions of Netscape because they had the bank men, the JavaScript debugger.

391
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:45.790
Duck Little: But early versions of Firefox for coming out there. We're getting really usable JavaScript was becoming slightly less Wild Wild West it with the concept of classes and even user interface toolkits

392
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:56.770
Duck Little: But really the main motivation was we needed to fix the relationship between a layer in the map and the definition of the map source.

393
01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.490
Duck Little: So we evolved the format.

394
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:05.620
Duck Little: Here you can see it's a map book we gave it a version of 2.0

395
01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:18.940
Duck Little: And we define this code snippet here that is for in this case aware of Fire, fire stations. It's saying that the type of this data is coming from Map Server.

396
01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:32.890
Duck Little: The name of the sources, the map source and this file element here is a shorthand to tell it. Okay, this is the map file so form the URL to work with that map file and inside of that map file. There's a layer name fire stations.

397
01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:45.730
Duck Little: This allows you to do quite a few things. First of all, it allows you to group multiple layers into a single request because you can put 10 layers from single WNs source in that way.

398
01:07:48.460 --> 01:08:04.570
Duck Little: It also lets you break out as an administrator. The defining the catalog. You can have a difference between how those layers are stacked where there's where those layer where those rendered layers are getting data from and how they're sorted in the hierarchy of your catalog.

399
01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:23.620
Duck Little: And this is a pretty basic juice two point O application, you can still see there's many, many layers that it's processing all at the same time. It's providing that asynchronous layer stack here in the map, along with a number of controls.

400
01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.560
Duck Little: But not everything was great about it.

401
01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:38.230
Duck Little: In terms of technical implementation, we had issues with what required what was a basically a custom Java compiler to

402
01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:44.470
Duck Little: Put the different bits of JavaScript together certain components stop working on newer versions of Internet Explorer.

403
01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:54.550
Duck Little: And a lot of JavaScript is moved to functional programming models which there was no way we could support with what we were doing. But most importantly, the downside was

404
01:08:55.570 --> 01:09:19.540
Duck Little: Because we had push all of the description into our map book XML format it got unwieldy large, it was unsustainable to define every UI element inside of the XML. We enlightened. All of these all of the code for styling data feedback, including pop ups and identify templates and

405
01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:29.530
Duck Little: So it was hard to keep moving it forward is hard to evolve the application because we've sort of built ourselves into A into a tag corner in XML.

406
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:42.760
Duck Little: Some other pretty important things happened while we were developing it Google tell the whole world about 10 different times and about 10 different ways people started putting mobile supercomputers in their hands.

407
01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:52.690
Duck Little: The Open Street Map project started. You know, publishing new innovative ways of structuring some Geo data.

408
01:09:53.110 --> 01:10:07.540
Duck Little: And a lot of vector data has gone to the web. You know, you think about the adaptation of geo JSON or matte box vector tiles. And the way you an administrator used to think about data was I have shaped files. I'm going to render them using my favorite

409
01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.820
Duck Little: Map rendering service and it's going to get put in the browser. But now,

410
01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:19.630
Duck Little: You could just have data sitting in in an S3 bucket somewhere. And I want to put that on my map, and that includes

411
01:10:19.930 --> 01:10:26.680
Duck Little: You know, Geo JSON data includes like matte box vector tiles could pre render a whole region of vector tiles and this even includes when you

412
01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:34.990
Duck Little: More stream bubble formats like cloud optimized. Notice what if I just have a picture. I want to slice and dice and it's properly index.

413
01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:46.090
Duck Little: Or streaming will JSON, things like new line to eliminate JSON that work with stream mobile web servers. I mean, cheap cloud compute means you can put terabytes of data on a map for pennies.

414
01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:55.690
Duck Little: So we thought we should adapt to the times and that brought about the juice 3.0 development.

415
01:10:57.070 --> 01:11:05.920
Duck Little: But even during our evaluation, even with all of the modern stuff that we were trying to to adopt and looking at new patterns.

416
01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:17.590
Duck Little: Of programming, we still came back to the best way to describe some of this stuff is knowing that there's a map that there are layers and that there are map sources and we can describe an XML.

417
01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:25.720
Duck Little: So we can still use us pretty familiar tags. So the new implementation was so fresh and so clean

418
01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:33.160
Duck Little: And looked almost exactly the same to to a lot of users, because what we were able to

419
01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:42.580
Duck Little: Develop a brand new application on a completely fresh stack, both to our administrators who are real target and

420
01:11:43.180 --> 01:12:00.010
Duck Little: To the users the application looked very, very the same. In fact, we were able to write a small conversion tool that allowed users of june moves to to upgrade their XML to June was three. In fact about 90% of the tags were able to migrate forward.

421
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:12.700
Duck Little: This has helped a lot. We've got the ability to handle different types of data sources be them be them raster vector or even

422
01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:18.700
Duck Little: Things like JSON and vector tiles. We can parse them natively and render them for users.

423
01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:27.070
Duck Little: We also created the idea of a query as concept because sometimes you have browsers have different capabilities and you might want to present the data differently.

424
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:41.890
Duck Little: For example you we have the ability to define a layer as being displayed in the map using a WNs source. But if you want to get the attributes for a future it'll use W Fs.

425
01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:51.130
Duck Little: But we learned some stuff and some real important lessons here cartography, it's hard.

426
01:12:51.850 --> 01:13:02.080
Duck Little: Picking how you want to style those features once they're in the browser can be very, very difficult. And there's been a lot of successes and failures. Over the years, you know, map CSS.

427
01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:06.880
Duck Little: There's been I think three different flavors of that throughout the years.

428
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:14.530
Duck Little: So LD the OTC standard for how to define a layer that gets pretty verbose, and can be very scary for people, even with editors.

429
01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:27.040
Duck Little: Matte box GL style sheets has been sort of a one organization show though it's been pretty innovative open layer styles styling, as you saw, as you could see in previous examples.

430
01:13:28.090 --> 01:13:35.320
Duck Little: Just in the demo set can get very complicated for simple things like a point and Map Server map files are really

431
01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:51.040
Duck Little: Great for styling stuff on the server. But there's no implementation in the client. And these are just the ones I could think of quickly that were mostly successes. At one point, there's been a lot of other things that have failed that the haven't quite made it through.

432
01:13:52.750 --> 01:14:04.270
Duck Little: The other thing we discovered is that performance can be quite hard. It's important to think about what happens when someone takes that really cheap available cloud compute power and tries to stuff it into your browser.

433
01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:15.670
Duck Little: Even with Web GL. You don't want to put gigabyte. You need to think about how you're going to put gigabytes of data onto your map.

434
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:31.540
Duck Little: And communicating. How do you the complex definitions can be hard as well. The query ass thing that I was previously bragging about is also one of the hardest concepts to explain to our administrators who are trying to do is get their data on the web.

435
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:40.960
Duck Little: Also some future challenges just in the mapping sphere that I think are are

436
01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:52.300
Duck Little: We're trying to deal with as a project we're trying to think about them. The first is 3D that beyond how you define that data and how you communicate that data.

437
01:14:52.900 --> 01:15:00.460
Duck Little: point clouds are as a technology really really evolving. There's an end, there's a project called entwine that puts 3D points into the map.

438
01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:12.100
Duck Little: And they've also become cheap and available because you can put a light or puck on relatively inexpensive hardware and collect gigabytes worth of 3D points very, very quickly.

439
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:23.920
Duck Little: Growing through mobile. It was also hard people just expect a single site to work on just about every device that they have no one wants to think about going to the slash m dot HTML site anymore.

440
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:36.850
Duck Little: And a lot of maps cheat this by having an m dot HTML site somewhere or require or saying this doesn't work in your browser. But users are no longer accepting that they wanted to work on their tablet their laptop.

441
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:43.240
Duck Little: Their 30 inch screen and their 3.75 inch diagonal screen that they carry with them all the time.

442
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:59.410
Duck Little: The other thing that's really ramping up that that it's going to get harder to describe is with a lot of the new satellite data Lance at Planet, etc. There's a lot of accessibility towards detailed multi band data that are getting pushed to the browser.

443
01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:05.560
Duck Little: And that's going to be a future challenge for describing a map.

444
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:14.650
Duck Little: So some big takeaways from the GMOs project through the years, you can XML it. There is a way of describing maps.

445
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:25.240
Duck Little: Where we can use XML and HTML tags to describe them and describe them effectively. We've got 15 years in the business at doing this. And so I think, and I think we do a good job.

446
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:39.250
Duck Little: Also, I really think the idea of having a map source definition and a layer definition is very, very important. You'll hit a wall very quickly if there isn't some sort of definition between there.

447
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:51.610
Duck Little: Styling is hard and gets complicated and needs to be considered hard and yes eventually a user will indeed try to stuff multiple gigabytes of data and render it in your browser.

448
01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:56.260
Duck Little: All right, I went kind of fast because it's

449
01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:01.960
Duck Little: Hoping to get a lot of content. But I'm always open to questions.

450
01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:11.440
Peter Rushforth: Thanks, Dan. That was really interesting.

451
01:17:15.190 --> 01:17:16.540
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Indeed, and

452
01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:18.340
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: A great

453
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:28.450
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Starting session for the workshop to give that historical perspective of how much has changed and how much we still have to work on.

454
01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:36.220
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The main forum for questions that we're going to

455
01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:37.990
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Try and encourage people to

456
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:40.810
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Use is the discourse.

457
01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:46.870
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Discourse dot W IC g.io and

458
01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:53.770
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: That way people can ask questions, even if they weren't here on the live session, they can

459
01:17:55.210 --> 01:17:57.100
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Follow up from watching the video.

460
01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:08.260
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So unless anyone else has any logistics. I think we will wrap it up for the day.

461
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:19.150
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: remind everyone to check the agenda for the next session, which is a little over 30 hours from now.

462
01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:26.260
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So either tomorrow or the next day depending on what time zone. You're starting in and

463
01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:34.090
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I will not be hosting that one I think Peter rush fourth is up for hosting day two.

464
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.330
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Will be talking about

465
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:55.030
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The map data and server standards OTC and how those standards are good for the web or maybe not good enough for the web. And we'll also have a hopefully very interesting panel.

466
01:18:57.610 --> 01:19:01.930
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Representatives from government geospatial data providers on

467
01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.910
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: What web maps mean to their organizations.

468
01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:11.860
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So I'd

469
01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:19.000
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Like to thank everyone who has joined us today, or who is watching after the fact.

470
01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.780
Peter Rushforth: posted links to the discourse.

471
01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:46.450
Peter Rushforth: Discourse forum with some topics. And as soon as that Dan's a presentation is available via video, I will post a link to that. But I'll post a link to his slides. First out with my appreciation Dennis really interesting, I would like to chat.

472
01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.210
Peter Rushforth: Anytime offline.

473
01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:52.060
Duck Little: Thanks, everyone.

474
01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:54.160
Peter Rushforth: Thank you.

475
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.700
Peter Rushforth: All right, we'll see you tomorrow.
