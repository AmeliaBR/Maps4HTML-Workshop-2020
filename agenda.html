<p>
  The workshop series will consist of scheduled video conference sessions
  (presentations, panel discussions, and in-depth breakout discussions)
  and asynchronous written discussion.
</p>
<p>
  The video conference sessions are grouped into
  blocks of 2 hours per day,
  and scheduled at different times each day to accomodate all time zones.
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/maps2020/">Registered participants</a>
  will receive an email with links to the video conference sessions.
  Videos of the workshop presentations and panels
  will be posted to the discussion forum.
  Participants can watch at their own schedule
  and leave written contributions.
</p>
<p>
  Breakout topics (45 minutes to 1 hour each) are scheduled
  following many of the main daily sessions,
  using the same video conference format.
  These sessions will allow smaller groups of interested workshop participants
  to hack on a technology or get a deeper understanding of a topic.
  Facilitators will start with a demo or tutorial of their project,
  and then open the discussion for questions and suggestions.
</p>

<div class="info">
  <p>
  Due to risks associated with global travel and the spread COVID-19,
  the Maps for the Web workshop series in 2020 will be online only,
  using a distributed, asynchronous model to encourage in-depth participation
  regardless of time zones.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is a new format for a W3C or OGC Workshop,
  and we're still finalizing the details of what it will look like.
  Suggestions from registered participants are welcome.

  Discussion will continue online through the month of October,
  in the hopes of gaining wide input towards a consensus on key issues.
  In late October, moderators will post final calls for consensus,
  summarizing the conclusions of each discussion.
  These summaries will then be integrated into a workshop report.

  Instructions for participants
</h2>
<p>
  The workshop series focuses on topics raised by participants in expressions of interest and position statements.
  Each topic will be introduced by one or more short (or lightning) talks, or an expert panel,
  and is then discussed among participants in the forums.
  The goal of each workshop discussion is not to resolve all technical issues of the topic,
  but to determine its relevance and priority to standardization.

  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Presentations are grouped by theme,
      to introduce topics for discussion.
      Talks are short (&lt;15 minutes each)
      and focused on introducing specific work or proposals.
    </p>
    <p>
      If time is available during the live video conference,
      some questions and discussion may follow the talk.
      Further questions and comments are encouraged in the online discussion.

  </dd>
  <dt class="schedule-item-type type-panel" id="panel">

    <p>
      Moderated panels provide an opportunity
      for more free-ranging discussion on a theme.
      Speakers are selected in advance by the program committee;
      an assigned moderator will introduce the speakers and coordinate the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panel discussions are only the start:
      the topics they introduce will be the start of open discussion online,
      where all workshop participants are encouraged
      to exchange ideas, assess priorities,
      and identify possible standardization actions.
      The moderator will be tasked with keeping the discussion on topic,
      and identifying areas of consensus for the final workshop report.

  <dd>
    <p>
      These sessions will support more collaborative discussion
      by smaller groups.
      Breakout sessions will cover more specific technical topics
      that didn't fit into the main workshop schedule.
      Hack sessions will welcome new collaborators to a software or data project,
      as discussed in the <a href="{{ relBase }}/call-for-participation#hack-day-proposals">call for participation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specific format will depend on the topic and goals of the session,
      but could include a mix of video presentations, live chat, and written discussion.
      Regardless of format,
      each group is expected to provide a written summary of their session.

<p>
  Breakout session organizers will be able to use the W3C's
  IRC server and meeting-management bots.
