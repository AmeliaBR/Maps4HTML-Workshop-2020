<p>The Peter Rushforth: First first workshop on map for the web.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: We do a free and Peter Rushforth: We Peter Rushforth: Don't have recording from this.</p>

<p>And so what you hope it's already recording.</p>

<p>Very good.</p>

<p>So moving on.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: So today's theme of toxicity advanced web graphics for mapping and then followed by a Peter Rushforth: Stakeholder panel on commercial mapping services and then we'll have a breakout breakout session on collaborative web mapping by Carol char vet and his team.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: And I just like to remind you that we have a gator gator chat channel open all the time.</p>

<p>So that's a good place to have threaded discussions about about ongoing topics and Peter Rushforth: The presenters will certainly welcome discussion and after the presentations today, I will create discourse topics in the web incubator community group for each of the presentations to Peter Rushforth: So that we can comment.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: on an ongoing basis there about web mapping it helps to gain attention to the topic of web mapping Peter Rushforth: In the browser community.</p>

<p>I'd like to remind everybody that the workshop is conducted under the W three C code of conduct which is linked from the each workshop page.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: So with that, I'd like to hand over the Peter Rushforth: Presenter controls to Yvonne Sanchez Ortega, the leaflet.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Weird web standards.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: That's me.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Perfect.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So I won't be here too.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Okay so hi everybody.</p>

<p>This is me one sentence with one of one Bronte talk about joysticks that took you some meetings, I have to change that, for reasons that will be later.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So for those who don't know me, I am a nerd.</p>

<p>I have been doing this lecture maps and overseas literally 15 years ago economic stuff.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: My allegiances are two words.</p>

<p>Open Street Map.</p>

<p>I have been a member of the board of the foundation.</p>

<p>A few years ago I am a charter member folks do I am a maintainer.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: I am very skeptical of this proposal so skeptical that I cannot tell you why in 15 minutes so I wrote willing to say about it, it's my personal statement as well.</p>

<p>So please read it.</p>

<p>If you have a time IvanSanchez: To save half your time, I'm going to focus on this part of the job.</p>

<p>I don't think that the mapping was done under the covers use cases.</p>

<p>I know this.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Because I have been dealing with approving leaflet plugins for a while and they are literally hundreds each plugin is a use case.</p>

<p>And I don't think IvanSanchez: The standard as it currently stands, is able to core all those use cases or even to accept the integration needed to cover these use cases.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Since I really struggling time I'm going to focus on integrations with existing brochure API's in particular.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Fever surprised that you probably didn't know that existed, which are digging API, the text starts 3D from what we have to UNKNOWN mutation observers.</p>

<p>So let's get on with it joysticks IvanSanchez: How do we interact with maps.</p>

<p>We do most interspeech point Iran's we do keyword events.</p>

<p>We also follow the user via Geolocation API. IvanSanchez: We also rotate the map, when we are navigating with the company orientation with relative orientation sensors, for instance, or API.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: We can also do an experiment about tilting a phone and tablet and then making them up slide off the surface of the phone and tablet by adapt some traditional sensor which I didn't really have time to play with the demo, but you can also do joysticks be gained by the API.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: And moving things with adjusting actually works.</p>

<p>He works.</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>It's easy to do something like this.</p>

<p>You just hook up IvanSanchez: The new events and works and exciting direction that nobody really has been thinking about works pretty well with game parts as well.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: And I have to say, this feels good.</p>

<p>And I also have this feeling that interaction with joysticks or gamepad it's something that IvanSanchez: I don't know what it's useful for but I feel like this is really useful for something.</p>

<p>I don't know what for steel.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So if this has to have the peripherals.</p>

<p>Maybe we'll under maybe we want some accessibility features, because some people might handle a controller billion keyboard and mouse.</p>

<p>I don't know how to work and I don't know how these kind of interactivity belongs or works with IvanSanchez: With my with my mental IvanSanchez: State only not sure about.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: I'm going to talk no executes.</p>

<p>So back when I was 17 I was doing some weird experiments.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Replacing the images from title maps with canvases.</p>

<p>And each candidate receives a buffer from Web GL and then you handle the textures and IvanSanchez: The title goes through a whole process to basically change the color.</p>

<p>And I have this feeling of this is useful for something.</p>

<p>I don't know what guy.</p>

<p>What for, but this has to be useful.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So one of the things I learned and this is important to keep in mind is what GL or OpenGL is not a 3D engine.</p>

<p>It's a to the train station engine.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: That takes a lot of four dimensional vectors combines it with bubbles of Iran Jabra and you just see me to this lectures and before the Code of Conduct police comes to me.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: And different about most of the youth the unit of measurement of alcoholic beverages, which is, in my opinion, with one person needs to really understand what the kale is going on you.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Know a normal person will will think that a picture is just an image, a core emits a beet red and blue.</p>

<p>And that's it.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: For instance, people who have been working in video games, know that textures coming more than images, do you have something like the Bama specular map, which is how a surface reflects the light that goes into a surface.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: And that can be boot as different formats 568 60 beats 42 it's not it's not necessarily HIV.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Then when you come to learn to learn what the gap is nurse from fo submission are doing for them roster data is temporal multi sectoral frenetic data, which a lot of tiny little squares and or cubes which eats it, holding 16 or 15 to 32 examples, one or more samples per pixel over IvanSanchez: The bridge is realizing that the roster data feeds natively into god and i mean president.</p>

<p>Nobody has noticed this before.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So you can use get data from GTS putting the texture and the you get the texture and that will get the native data.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: The raw data with no transformations from the beauty 591 of the nicest things or what do too is that you get for 32 format and you get actual data cubes in the form of 3D textures.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So in this example in getting this pseudo code.</p>

<p>Anyway, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>I can get several samples from a duty file.</p>

<p>And since they are back together one IvanSanchez: After the other, they will have the same format or the same data structure that 3D textures need for this.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: And then you just fetch the initiator and then you can fleet coordinates, you can use in this example.</p>

<p>A will be using just the different IvanSanchez: Channels are fundamentally similar samples of duty file or the South Korea, but you could easily, easily change these IvanSanchez: handled the coordinators with about a little union zero to x is changes or whatever you want.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: One up sample.</p>

<p>I have been working on is this one with some central data in this I have an actual data you've heard tile.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Each of the 252 56 a picnic style.</p>

<p>It's not a tile.</p>

<p>It's a small data youth to fish disease like to fix the six by seven.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So you can fetch structures for any of those points taken the linear interpolation between the balance.</p>

<p>You can do all that stuff.</p>

<p>And I can do something nice, really nice, which is real time roster processing and analysis, which is IvanSanchez: For me it's just beautiful.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Things like this.</p>

<p>I don't know what I'm doing.</p>

<p>But I'm doing the real time on the GPU with a bro you in 16 we do data from actual Centennial settlements.</p>

<p>This is great.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: I want to throw some battles with you because I feel like doing this.</p>

<p>It makes me a cool person.</p>

<p>This is real time, meaning it happens once per frame which for for normal people is real time.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: For electronics people it's not real time.</p>

<p>It's a different IvanSanchez: Discussion.</p>

<p>This is real time GPS later be safe happens in a graphics card.</p>

<p>It's cloudless because he doesn't depend on this cloud of service, which are somewhere that don't worry about IvanSanchez: It as computing the to sit happens on the user's computer.</p>

<p>It's for Calculus.</p>

<p>MR. J. Because you can apply the algorithms for removing clouds from Centenary detail for multi or IvanSanchez: Hyper spectral later.</p>

<p>And one of the issues I think this has is that it's difficult to monetize because we've cloud computing.</p>

<p>It's really easy to know how many CPU cycles you have been selling to the users, but once that happens on the user's computer IvanSanchez: You can agree measure how much he worked the user's computer has done using your code.</p>

<p>So yeah, there's not a lot of money and people involved in this kind of research.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Anyhow, I do predict by the in three years time, every GIS person involved in Earth observation and restaurants is will ask themselves how do we not this year.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: I don't know how familiar with this, and seeing the performance of GL and having seen how a low level deconstruction's work.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: I do not know how can we squeeze this thing.</p>

<p>I do not know how can we make non 3D GL more accessible to any other developers, because God has a lot of potential for restaurant analysis and we're not squeezing it IvanSanchez: I think it's because the API is when whenever we talk all the way up to.</p>

<p>We already think we are already thinking into 3D and 3D models and a camera and an object and light sources.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: How can we change this perception, because if we change this perception.</p>

<p>I think we will improve roster analyses and any other kinds of sciences.</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p>I want to make this happen.</p>

<p>So I don't know how to get rid of the preconception that we should use as Biggie for IvanSanchez: For doing graphics.</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p>I'm unsure.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: I'm going to go to part three.</p>

<p>So mutants.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: And I'm going to start with this fact that I am not going to accept any discussion on this fact leaflet users want to display Google Muslims, they want to.</p>

<p>This is a fact.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Now it's easy.</p>

<p>You just put this island of Haitian and it works.</p>

<p>And you have to do nothing else and you know one line of code, it works.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: That IvanSanchez: Google doesn't want you to do that at least if they didn't, as of 2018 with this wording of the terms of service, you might not access map tiles two interfaces that are not documented.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Or that you don't have access to the wording of the current are some services not clear.</p>

<p>So I know that Parsons is somewhere in the room.</p>

<p>So can I have a clarification of these, please.</p>

<p>Pretty please with turned off.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Anyhow, how do you overcome this limitation.</p>

<p>What do you do you get at least lips, once the other screen and a Google map on another side of the screen.</p>

<p>Do you hook them up.</p>

<p>So whenever you move the leaflet map the Google Map morphs IvanSanchez: Whenever you soon delete the map the Google Map moves and then you do CSS trickery.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: And it works.</p>

<p>It kind of works.</p>

<p>So right now you can do leaflet with some Google Base maps and bat bat that lacks a lot of lagging IvanSanchez: There's a lot of line when you move in it because you will not be like at least one frame behind IvanSanchez: And when you're swimming, swimming, you see any nation sub not the door for the same function so staff gets not very user friendly.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So you can overcome that by doing DOM manipulation, which is even dirtier.</p>

<p>So you make the same thing.</p>

<p>You hook them up.</p>

<p>So when I read the leaflet map moves moves moves and then you manipulate the DOM to steal the titles.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: And it works.</p>

<p>And now the tiles and delete the container and there's no lag because the movements or control only by leaflet on a don't care what the Google model might be during with her and now empty title container in IvanSanchez: The League, you have to reach to that house.</p>

<p>Anytime you move and there's a lot of race conditions because this synchronous because it depends on the network.</p>

<p>And then you have so many issues.</p>

<p>So the synchronicity is hard.</p>

<p>And you know what new towns will come in.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So you can use mutation observers.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Do you lose some do 317 or for the Google Map, then your desktop server and you get told whenever any DOM element is created inside that IvanSanchez: In that in that way you can automatically stigmatize to your doctrine.</p>

<p>Don't frydman whenever the title is ready and it works and it works pretty nicely.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So, IvanSanchez: It just works.</p>

<p>And obviously, there's the same CSS trickery to get logo on the bottom and stuff like that.</p>

<p>But it works and compared to leave lips.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Native geometries.</p>

<p>There's absolutely no lag whatsoever.</p>

<p>The tsunamis.</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>

<p>It just works.</p>

<p>Now this has been cold.</p>

<p>And for me this is high praise.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Absolutely brilliant and trouble at the same time.</p>

<p>And they think, so this is something that should have accessed.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: And this is, to me, one of my heart points of view might be controversial, but I, this is one of the he'll say will die or IvanSanchez: Vendors should be able to expose should be exposing standard interfaces.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: Authors should be able to cash or the map acids plan to should be able to interchange exchange the those map assets by P2P because one of the excuses that we have been given for paying for maps is that there is a cost associated with it if it was peer to peer that cost, we'd go down.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: So that's something that, for me, it's quite important.</p>

<p>I also think that don't mutation observers shouldn't exist they break IvanSanchez: The encapsulation of coding web applications.</p>

<p>And it's the as dirty very dirty hacks and mutant as a whole as a concept.</p>

<p>It shouldn't exist.</p>

<p>I shouldn't IvanSanchez: Have to spend any time making it really, it has no reason, there should be no reason for it to exist at all.</p>

<p>So one of my biggest complaints or IvanSanchez: Critiques of mock Mill is that matter metal shall not fix any of this mapping will will not make benders explosive standard interfaces will not offer cash map assets so they can IvanSanchez: They can control all the things that they displaying their web pages, it will not let clients need to be exchanged my pastors, we would be a boon for all IvanSanchez: For everybody.</p>

<p>It will not deprecate Berkshire APIs, because we all, we only put more and more and more and more in browsers and it will not stop people from doing either hacks.</p>

<p>IvanSanchez: That's my main point about why I don't like or very condensed in this short talk IvanSanchez: And that's why I have please read my essay, and that's it.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Well, thank you for that excited worth of your, your thinking on the subject and I put a few comments in chat.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Though with that, we're going to move on to Peter Rushforth: Our next presentation, which is not compositions format by Carol star that Peter Rushforth: Over to you.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: I think you're on you.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Know, Karel Charvat: Thanks to give us chance to make our presentation here now in just short introduction, I will only make some messy.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: short messages about what we are doing and Karel Charvat: To the data we will present it later in breakout session where my colleagues or not.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>This will give you also more technical details so Karel Charvat: Even before spoke about things related to his leaflets.</p>

<p>We will now move to other technologies more or to open less and Karel Charvat: You guess but it's the first I will tell about what and why we are speaking about composition.</p>

<p>What even presented it was mainly focus on some expert to our quiz.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Visit geographic information.</p>

<p>But what what is this clear.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: What is not working.</p>

<p>I'm looking for is my image.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: I have to move to move this presentation.</p>

<p>I don't know why.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: I'm Peter Rushforth: showing it off your desktop or from the web.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: No, I, I'm doing this is from my desktop as Peter Rushforth: Well maybe exit presentation mode and go back in Ted Guild: We mastered at the bottom.</p>

<p>Valerie.</p>

<p>I was also seeing a next next them back button to the bottom can move your mouse to the bottom.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: The presentation, you're hovering over or the end.</p>

<p>I've seen some some buttons here.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: But once I don't see Ted Guild: You move further down Ted Guild: Mickey Mouse further down Ted Guild: No hear you.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Now, okay, okay.</p>

<p>Sorry for this.</p>

<p>Some right we are speaking about map composition and we will speak also not only about my composition, but about Karel Charvat: Cooperation, if you are looking on the classical map.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Is there is a Karel Charvat: Number of different information now with your geographic information systems, we are dealing with layers.</p>

<p>Yes, but layers are not met, and what is important.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: For people who are not expert to move from last two maps and the open this first time when we do a lot, you know, the check ins by Joe Batali, it was around 2010 you can see on one side how hook some other side, if we are looking on the data.</p>

<p>It looks approximately Karel Charvat: Such but we have to move from this layer Polycom to Karel Charvat: Him also map and first time we talked about this when we implemented this inspired job portal and in this time we start to see my contacts, it was Karel Charvat: In the past, some Odyssey standard about with some limitation and this limitation was mainly that it will work only with the w.</p>

<p>So services and not there are no possibility to integrate Karel Charvat: Other as a data, but we extended this in this time to this concept and on the check ins by job.</p>

<p>What are we start to offer to the people tab matic maps, nor players but the non expired was able to select the Karel Charvat: Some concrete composition of oils and work with this because for many people it is very difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Who is understand other things, and also decided in reach scale, you have to put the Karel Charvat: Ritual era.</p>

<p>So this could be or has to be in some way described in this ethical position or what we are now calling the maps.</p>

<p>You can see here we have Karel Charvat: Number of layers, but on the entry to have the maps, for example, just combination of this satellite images.</p>

<p>Open Street Map or other and we have an hour no huge number of new technologies HTML CSC Jason and Karel Charvat: It is important to use this technology, how to describe them we develop our own a JSON format for describing of medical position later in the evening, right, this will Karel Charvat: Tell you about this.</p>

<p>And I think that today we think is also good opportunity.</p>

<p>How to discuss and speed.</p>

<p>How, for example, this approach, which we are now pushing can be combined with other effort and other standard in in all GC or in WCC and Karel Charvat: Having here, my colleague, I think that it is a good opportunity to start discussion with other how we can combine this our approach, which is now used very often we implemented this approach, not only for open labs, but we are able to share maps with Karel Charvat: hubris and to restart also some tests, though, is very flat.</p>

<p>So the idea is that the demand is defined and could be shared.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: On other places.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Right, who are now sharing music, who are sharing other you can have the syllabus and you can from the syllabus, you'll be able Karel Charvat: To share zoom as a service could be some met catalog, not only catalogs for web services or other but to have the cutouts also the maps and to be able to share with other people know the maps.</p>

<p>Second thing, so we you will today speak much more is Karel Charvat: What we are calling on my whiteboard.</p>

<p>What is it, Karel Charvat: You are probably all working grace Google Documents Google Documents is something where you can share the text and many people can edit this text.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: From different places and collaborative way you can work with the map.</p>

<p>It could be important for many application for education.</p>

<p>It could be good for farmers, it could be good in Karel Charvat: Crisis Management.</p>

<p>If you are able to share the maps, you are able to share all else, you are able to Karel Charvat: Share your drawings immediately and other people can communicate, who is this of course this is now more and more important in coach Barrios to have real collaborative work.</p>

<p>And this is what we are now working and what we will speak, as I mentioned, there is so many Karel Charvat: Many application where this could be used, of course, in education, typical place would be spatial planning, it could be agriculture to be possible to share the maps and to edit the maps collaboratively and to share this map so is Karel Charvat: Other people.</p>

<p>So this is some short introduction, and I hope that some from you will be able to stay to the end and we will be able to expand you in today.</p>

<p>Tyler, what is our medical position.</p>

<p>And what is this map provide board.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Hello.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Carol.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: We're going to move on to Daniel more sets will be a map yours will be talking about Peter Rushforth: The implementation of math ML and Map Server D Delano GR over to you, Daniel.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: Thank you, Peter.</p>

<p>So my slides are on right Daniel Morissette: As soon so Daniel Morissette: So, Daniel Morissette: Talk about yeah the implementations that we put in place a map surgery Delano jr essentially kicking the tires to see how it goes with the current draft version of the spec.</p>

<p>As of the spring.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: Okay, so for those who may not be from the GIS World Map Server is a web mapping engine.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: Open Source we're mapping engine, the G doll library is, I guess, the Swiss Army Knife of GIS.</p>

<p>It's a library that supports hundreds of raster and vector data formats and both are open source projects have do open source geospatial foundation Daniel Morissette: So the stuff I'm going to talk about today's implemented and available as a reference implementation in open source format.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: First for the keys of Map Server, there's a link to the documentation there.</p>

<p>It's been discussed in labs RFC 123 is going to be included in the maps over eight release.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: The moment it's available to a good source GitHub source fork, but the implementation is going to be released later this fall, essentially.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: For those new Map Server.</p>

<p>You've probably all already published WNs ne WS service.</p>

<p>So all you need is a W massively bold map file that you've got already Daniel Morissette: you enable the get map ML, a new vendor specific get a request, and that's it.</p>

<p>The rest is magic handled by Map Server and the political viewer to the map a Mil Spec so Daniel Morissette: Essentially in your map layer tags know the map ML layer tags you include Daniel Morissette: A custom URL, which is service.</p>

<p>It was the weirdest request equals getting up a male, and then you specify which layer, you're referring to, from your map file and the projection using the production code, the maximal production code.</p>

<p>So essentially, Daniel Morissette: Yeah, it looks like this in the HTML.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: And Daniel Morissette: Yeah, this is the actual source code from an example.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: And I'm gonna swap to just to show to show it in action.</p>

<p>Just show that it's a real thing and it really works.</p>

<p>So Daniel Morissette: I this is by the way, this is the documentation from the master side.</p>

<p>So it talks about the metadata elements, the configuration elements that you can use to control the behaviors.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: And essentially, the viewer looks like this.</p>

<p>So it's just a simple leaflet.</p>

<p>What's the benefit of you are that you're seeing here.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: Planting to AWS layer.</p>

<p>So the source code of this page is this with this get map ML URL pointing to the Map Server map file.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: And if you look at the source of what map server returns.</p>

<p>It's a map ML document so implementing the draft specification Daniel Morissette: Which contains link rel equals image so full screen, image maps are requested using this URL template.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: And for the get when you query the map.</p>

<p>So the link rel equals query points to get feature info using the template.</p>

<p>So all this you know this is a bit verbose, but it's all handled by an app server, you don't need to do any of that really all the Daniel Morissette: All you need to do is create this layer element in your HTML to make it work and have a Map Server AWS and rebuild Map Server map file.</p>

<p>So back to the slides.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: Yep.</p>

<p>So that's what I talked about.</p>

<p>There's a so the case, I've been showing was the link relic was image which returns Daniel Morissette: full page web request, but the implementation also support styled request.</p>

<p>So you can request type WS request or Daniel Morissette: There's a custom molded maps or which is more the call style which mimics I believe the Google Maps API. Daniel Morissette: Time requests or that one is supported as well.</p>

<p>There is a future plan to have the ability to do a who has get feature we using link requires feature.</p>

<p>And as I mentioned earlier, Daniel Morissette: Link rel equals query would point to get feature info to the famous get feature and forth to allow you to query the map.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: So that's it for the Map Server implementation and now Daniel Morissette: For those who like to work with data would like to generate a static data set and hosted without Daniel Morissette: Any server side components, an implementation has been made as well on in G doll for the rest are side and you know GR for the vector side.</p>

<p>So as I said, Daniel Morissette: The Gita library support hundreds of vector and raster formats and what's been done on the HR side that's been added recently in Daniel Morissette: Order to version three one, which was sometimes in the spring or the summer the documentation is available at this URL.</p>

<p>So it's part of the it's methanol driver ESSENTIALLY NEW jr driver.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: And it will read and write maternal vector features.</p>

<p>So, it reads its own Nathanael, it will not read an email because there could be too many variants Daniel Morissette: But it will spit out math ML output and the comments for those who are familiar with the audio to jr syntax which is probably not too many people because it's very cryptic Daniel Morissette: Essentially, if you were to use it to Joe, Joe, Joe.</p>

<p>Joe, you would specify, let's say in this case I'm going from a point five, which is a shape file I'm creating a map ML file.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: And I'm running an SQL query on it to just select some attributes.</p>

<p>I'm interested in, and only select the the populated places have more than 100,000 people and I'm passing some custom contents for the HTML header for the methanol header in this case.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: So that's the way to do it on the command line with Joe, Joe.</p>

<p>Joe, Joe.</p>

<p>For those who are familiar with that or just export to map ML from an old car enabled software and Daniel Morissette: About any piece of GIS software does portal GR so that would make it fairly widely available, then you will refer to this math ML file from earlier element in the map.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: To be fair, I, I have had some glitches with the current poly field trying to do that.</p>

<p>So I need to do more tests and probably go back and forth with Peter on the implementation, but the implementation.</p>

<p>Who's your, you know, Jr does produce the valid map them out.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: And then on the roster side.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: The Gita two times utility, which can be used to Daniel Morissette: Taking a roster image and generate a tile pyramid and it can it already supported the camel output.</p>

<p>So it's been extended to support Daniel Morissette: meta, meta output.</p>

<p>So essentially when you run it will take a wrestler image created a title pyramid that I set out of it and then create a map email header file that refers to it that you can use to host the data afterwards.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: And the common looks something like this.</p>

<p>So it's a command line utility in that case.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: So, and then you take your output folder and then and place it on your web server to host and refer to it in from your map element in the HTML.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: Have to say that this is the implementations in general, you know, Jr word done by event have always the maintainer of God knows your so he has to be thanked for that work.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: And that's about it.</p>

<p>So the quick introductions or three implementations.</p>

<p>I know there are more Joe server has an implementation as well.</p>

<p>Daniel Morissette: That's been done.</p>

<p>And there's a few others that maybe people will be better than me to list, but there's a few reference implementation.</p>

<p>So that's, I guess, a good way to start to see the recommended action and see how it goes.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Yeah, great.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Danielle.</p>

<p>The anyhow.</p>

<p>It's great to see a math amount being incorporated into these mainstream open source tools, showing the web platform community that we are in serious and intend to meet them halfway.</p>

<p>So what we're trying to get them to come out of their houses.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: OK, so moving on to Peter Rushforth: Our next presentation we're going to have a lightning lightning round from address which Mr. The open layers project on offspring canvas for rendering performance and risk.</p>

<p>Are you ready to go.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: Ready to go.</p>

<p>You Peter Rushforth: Your audio is a little choppy right now I Peter Rushforth: Don't know if there's anything you can do but Andreas Hocevar: On screen sharing Yeah.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: So I'm going to talk about a way to improve rendering performance of huge vector tiles data sets in open layers.</p>

<p>And I guess this topic might be of interest.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: Because as long as map ml is not available in mainstream browsers mapping libraries will have to provide your own renders Andreas Hocevar: And the goal here is of a project that was funded as part of the maps for HTML effort which I'm very thankful for was proof of concept to improve rendering performance and avoid blocking the UI in open layers.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: For those who don't come from a web mapping background open there's is a library for creating interactive maps.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: On the Web and it can display map tiles, which can be raster tiles, like the ones that Daniel was talking about, but also vector tiles.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: Also untitled vector data and super markers loaded from any source on any web page.</p>

<p>And this can really be a huge amount of data later on in this presentation I will be showing Andreas Hocevar: vector tiles data set where a single title which covers more than 512 by 512 pixels on the screen can be more than 500 kilobytes, which translates to 10s of thousands of vectors.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: And unfortunately, the makers of open layers which include myself are not as smartest and Microsoft metrics channel chess, which has a super fast and performance and good looking.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: Website render in open.</p>

<p>There's rendering is done using the canvas to the API, which means the cheap.</p>

<p>You can not be leveraged to such a high extent.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: And this is also the reason why such heavy maps as I just mentioned can cause slight performance problems.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: So what is the problem.</p>

<p>Typical rendering pipeline for Web Map consists of loading data parsing data, rendering the data and then of course the user interacting with the data, which means zooming and panning the map querying attribute informations and things like that.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: With the standard browser API's for asynchronous neatly fetching data loading already runs without blocking the UI.</p>

<p>So in this graphics that I'm going to show each row.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: Represents things that that have has to have to be done in parallel.</p>

<p>So in this standard open layers map loading can happen in parallel, while other tasks.</p>

<p>Go on parsing rendering and interacting with the data.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: Loading the data is not the problem here.</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>It gets interesting with parsing data, the more data you have, the longer it takes to parse it, but the Andreas Hocevar: The real bottleneck with a canvas 3D render is the rendering process itself openers is also very flexible with rendering it allows you to style your map your vector map.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: With functions that can look at each feature and decide based on that, how to render the feature.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: So it's very flexible here and it's all in this context is also not easy to prepare that data in a way that GPU can Andreas Hocevar: Run it in in a in a parallel way that would give a huge performance benefit.</p>

<p>That's also one of the differences to Netflix churches where you have styling language and not arbitrary style JavaScript functions to style your data.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: So, Andreas Hocevar: One thing we could do would be to use the web workers API that's available in all modern web browsers.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: This would allow us to load and parse data in parallel.</p>

<p>And in one thread and to render and interact in another Andreas Hocevar: The problem here is that transferring data between a worker and domains read is only efficient with structured data like type arrays.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: And at this stage, we don't have that structured data or already.</p>

<p>We still have vector data that could be Andreas Hocevar: Different types of geometries and we have to combine them with styles that are still JavaScript functions.</p>

<p>So, we cannot really create a type structure that can be efficiently transferred from the worker to the main spread Andreas Hocevar: So one solution to that would be the use of offscreen canvas.</p>

<p>That's a new API that's already available in Chrome.</p>

<p>And what I'm going to show now is a proof of concept of making use of this API.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: By using offspring canvas.</p>

<p>We can also use also put the rendering separate from interacting with the map, which in Andreas Hocevar: As a consequence, results in no more blocked you i by heavy calculations going on.</p>

<p>So we can load parse and render the data in a worker off screen canvas allows us to prepare a canvas in a worker and transfer it efficiently to the main thread, where we interact with the map.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: Now let me show you how that looks.</p>

<p>When we apply that technique.</p>

<p>In this video I'm going to show on the left.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: You see the use of offspring canvas on the right you see the same map rendered with open layers, without any any workers and this is the data set I talked about were just a single tire can have 10s of thousands of vectors.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: So this is how it looks.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: As you can see on the left, everything smooth.</p>

<p>The only delay comes from loading and parsing the data, but the UI is not blocked and you see on the right side how the UI is stuttering as this automatic and I'm animation that seems and pans, the map around is going on.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: So why don't we use this by default.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: As I already mentioned.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: It's already available in Chrome.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: But that's about it.</p>

<p>So it's available in the blink engine, which is now also used by Microsoft Edge, there is limited.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: Offering Canvas support in Firefox, but only for web channel contexts, not for the canvas to the context that we use in open layers and it's hidden behind an experimental flag, so not available to the average user and it's not available at all in WebKit engine, which is used by Safari.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: So this is please WebKit and Gecko developers implement off screen canvas.</p>

<p>When this is available in all mainstream browsers, we can provide good performance improvements.</p>

<p>Andreas Hocevar: And it will make it easier to wait until browsers have native map rendering available with map ML in a hopefully not too far away future Andreas Hocevar: Thanks in advance WebKit and Gecko for implementing that hopefully soon.</p>

<p>And thanks again maps for HTML community for funding this afforded that allowed us to explore the benefits we can gain from using off screen canvas in open layers.</p>

<p>Thank Peter Rushforth: Thank you very much undressed for your contribution to the community and hopefully we'll get some attention for those features in Peter Rushforth: Safari and Firefox as a result of your efforts so Peter Rushforth: Moving on to our next presentation we're going to hear about dynamic and observational spatial data from Thomas slider helped of under shop and Catarina shite ships like Peter Rushforth: I pronounced that correctly.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: Is correct good Kathi Schleidt: Anything.</p>

<p>Um, can I take the screen.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: Share yeah good working.</p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>So we're going to start filling, some of the gaps which have been showing up in today's presentations I admit I noticed the word sensor being there and suddenly going away.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: So now it comes back, big time, what are we, what are we talking about these various dynamic data in a spatial context.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: And we start with Kathi Schleidt: How we provide a basic attributes.</p>

<p>So in a normal world.</p>

<p>You've got some some object, you have two characteristics of the object, the color, the expression Kathi Schleidt: These are simple attributes pertaining to the object and they have values and everything is fine until you start realizing you need additional metadata.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: So that's why we've got the observational models where you realize okay yes I know the color is yellow, but Kathi Schleidt: That I was methodology.</p>

<p>How was that used what could the colors be what is the data quality all of this information is missing with simple attribute Kathi Schleidt: And we need this with measurement data.</p>

<p>The problem is when you get confronted with a pile of these it is not easy to play with.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: And so the users get this.</p>

<p>They look very confused, what they really want this this they want nice simple flat tables, they can stuff into there are and get on with it.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: Or some simple way of mapping, but not the holy mess.</p>

<p>So they have have a simplified world, but then they start realizing that all of these additional bits were relevant after all.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: And then they're not happy or and this is where we've been making good progress with center things technology because really allows us the various different viewpoints on this.</p>

<p>The only problem is how do we get this October.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: So I've taught background of sensor things as I'm aware of this community is not familiar with this.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: It's a technology that produced by OTC 2016.</p>

<p>It comes from the IoT world.</p>

<p>It's a wonderful standardized way of representing sensors actuators also simulations.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: And it's built on a long history of VCs standards dealing with what they refer to a sensor web enabled man that's insulated determining how can we get this type of dynamic sentence or measurement observation data saintly connected with with maps and spatial data.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: Relevant domains which is being applied.</p>

<p>I mean, it's very strongly in the in the environmental fact sector.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: It's also used in building management systems.</p>

<p>Smart Cities industry 4.0 is going in this direction, but Kathi Schleidt: The world has been working with this model we've realized it's so flexible that one of our recent prototypes has been putting European demography data online and it works beautifully.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: So it's a really a very nice flexible technology.</p>

<p>When you've got dynamic data pertaining to your spatial objects.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: Um, okay, that's the bit of the history of it.</p>

<p>I'll sport.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: What's it about.</p>

<p>It's got a core data model in the background, which covers all of the concept.</p>

<p>He to really nicely structure measurement data.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: This comes from the background of it is the OTC observations and measurement standard has been formalized as either 19 156 Kathi Schleidt: That provides is basic core.</p>

<p>It's been a bit specialized here for the purpose of sensor things and provides when has the, the resulting values.</p>

<p>But when also has what was observed how was it observe.</p>

<p>Where was it observe festival article information.</p>

<p>It's all there.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: But the problem is, okay, let me just more explanation of this.</p>

<p>It's based on the oasis.</p>

<p>Oh, data model we've got various get post patch.</p>

<p>Put the lead you can input output all of your data.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: And we've got various query parameters which allow you to really nicely deal with the RESTful interface.</p>

<p>And we've got an MTT interface in the back end so totally suited for clicking on sensors plug and play.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: The problem is the query logic and if you think back to the data model.</p>

<p>I was showing before most simple spatial application spiel of individual objects with attributes and geometries.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: They do not have this complex structure between the classes.</p>

<p>And this is a central in order to really access the state because you need the the pieces from the individual concept that's the center of things query logic allows you to really Kathi Schleidt: You can formulate your queries, based on the graph defined by the data model.</p>

<p>And so this way.</p>

<p>We basically we haven't come up with a square, you cannot formulate and my slick where Kathi Schleidt: The and what we want to do with me.</p>

<p>Here's an example from the Austrian air quality data, you've got to put your data on the map.</p>

<p>You've got your points where you have it.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: The problem is what happens you have too many points, you need to put little circles with numbers.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: Want to get to the points you want to see what is available there the list here are the thermal properties available from the station office now.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: And then if you click on one of these.</p>

<p>You want to see the time series of the actual value.</p>

<p>This is what we would want.</p>

<p>And this is what to at least until a few weeks ago and the developer who want to expose this data have to do manually.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: A further trick which we have there also pertains to multi resolution date if you zoom in or if you're looking at a very course map of Europe, you don't need also details.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: And more you zoom in, the more you really need all of the tricky.</p>

<p>It's and we see this nicely.</p>

<p>There's an example from from Norway.</p>

<p>We've got on the left, we've got the Kathi Schleidt: Sort of the big picture data which vaguely finds the islands.</p>

<p>On the right, we've got the very hot, very high resolution each your is in their Kathi Schleidt: Center things allows us to cope with this because one spatial object you have multiple locations.</p>

<p>And so we've made good use of this by Kathi Schleidt: storing all five different resolutions as locations, having a flag in the data showing which resolution, it is and the map viewer pulls the right resolution with me.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: So what did we do to get out of this.</p>

<p>We currently have a we've been discussing what do we call it, it's not really a plug in, it's for a plug off.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: It's a small little JavaScript library which handles all of the tricky pits, we've been discussing the at, how do you show the different resolutions, how do you out alternate Kathi Schleidt: Alternative alternatively show pin pins for the individual stations, you can show if it's too many just provide number Kathi Schleidt: That various integrated call back so you can pre configure it and say, when you click on the point then get this call back to show the observable properties.</p>

<p>When you click on individual thing they're all that function to show the graph.</p>

<p>It's available on GitHub by the link here.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: Functionality I shown here.</p>

<p>We've got an overview of the configuration options.</p>

<p>I mean, is basically one large dot you've not been large, medium sized JSON object which you can figure Kathi Schleidt: Fill up fill out these parameters, fill out the parameters.</p>

<p>The next page.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: And it then you once you have this field, you have to tell it is working with leaflet open layers and then it seamlessly integrates with whatever map software you have underneath as all of this functionality, everything is good.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: So conclusion center things API is becoming increasingly deploy more and more domains are covering the power of it.</p>

<p>Kathi Schleidt: Map based visualization has been the tricky point and with our sensor things API map library.</p>

<p>We think this is a Kathi Schleidt: good first step at providing simple support for this more information that's what was the work was done under the API for inspire politic founded by the European elite program.</p>

<p>More information at the link I presented.</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Kathy Thomas on hookah.</p>

<p>A very interesting presentation on and Peter Rushforth: So that's we're a little bit ahead of schedule but that's good because that leaves, lots of time to chat.</p>

<p>And at this point, maybe I'll turn it over to Ted guy on the W three see who's going to moderate a panel for us today.</p>

<p>So I'll Peter Rushforth: Pass it over to you, Ted.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Thank you, Peter.</p>

<p>My name is Title I am the Ted Guild: CEO of motive Lee and also the contact with us special on the web.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: And also part of the program committee for this workshop stable.</p>

<p>We haven't stakeholder stakeholder panel.</p>

<p>My commercial mapping services and a lead from the providers perspective.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: rejoined by number of commercial map service providers will give partial overview of their current solutions swivels with business and technical perspectives on specific challenges and opportunities they see for the global map community to consider.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: As we seek to make a snowman press passes and on the web.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Peter at the outset, or minus of the code of conduct and Ted Guild: Unlike chris wallace in his moderation of the US Presidential Debate hesitate to new for people to speak over each other trading insults.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Me anyhow.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: More seriously, like to have this an open discussion.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: open dialogue and my role is to try and facilitate the conversation, try and engage the various panelists.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: To speak to each other directly and when and where possible they to involve the audience in that as well.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So with that, I'll introduce the panelists and going alphabetically by last name sort of at Parsons from Google.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: That is the geospatial technologist, Google has responsibility for evangelizing Google's missions, or a nice world's information using geography.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Is a member of the board of directors for the Open Geospatial Consortium was quite sure if it's up to see what you see special deal a web working group that we please Ted Guild: Further, tell us a little bit about yourself.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): I would thank you very much tag and state to have a th began.</p>

<p>So he basically one.</p>

<p>My mother always used to say.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): And yeah, I've been involved.</p>

<p>I suppose in in geospatial for pretty much all of my career I set up a Ed Parsons (Google): Original HTTP D server on an old Mac in my office.</p>

<p>When I was an academic many, many years ago.</p>

<p>And one of the first things I tried to do then was to put a map on to a web page using the original map tag in HTML.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): And I've been trying.</p>

<p>I suppose to major especially information more maitri more usable Addison think we've done a good job in doing that, up until this point in time and I continue to do that in my job at Google.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Thank you.</p>

<p>Next we have your hottest lower from here, the hottest versus crystal technical product manager within the department of content engineering Ted Guild: Here technologies with me about making a map content and just ingestion.</p>

<p>The main fields of his interest.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Your eyes.</p>

<p>Can you please tell us a bit more about yourself.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: Yes, thanks for the brief introduction, Ted.</p>

<p>I just have to look for the mute button.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: Alright so hi everybody.</p>

<p>So my name is Johan flower yes mentioned I'm working at here technologies.</p>

<p>Before joining here, roughly five years ago.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: I worked at Heidelberg University and did a lot of things about geographic data sets.</p>

<p>Open Street Map, things like that frontier geographic information and parts of my PhD was about Johannes Lauer: Doing sensor data analytics from agricultural machinery building maps out of the movement and the telemetry data of tractors.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: So, Johannes Lauer: Yeah, building the digital representation of Johannes Lauer: The current reality into the map.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Thank you.</p>

<p>Next, Daniel Lewis from Judah Daniels this year data scientists working on smart cities projects and predictive maintenance projects the data analytics team at geotab Ted Guild: He has focused primarily on leveraging machine learning tools and techniques which is spatial data to create innovative products from connected vehicle data, ranging from congestion analysis.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: To identification that road network changes.</p>

<p>Daniel you please tell us more about yourself.</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Daniel: So yeah, I come into this kind of conference says a Daniel: Very much a newbie to geospatial data and maps.</p>

<p>My background, my undergrad is actually in semiconductor physics and my masters in biomedical engineering.</p>

<p>So pretty far away from Daniel: Mapping technologies, then through interest and happenstance.</p>

<p>I ended up working in the telematics space where of course primarily Daniel: Almost all of our data is geospatial list and been kind of on a rapid learning curve you up to speed on this map things so it can bring a perspective from someone who's knocking grained in the field from the outset.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Thank you, Thomas Lee from matte box is currently the policy leave there and parse that he was leading the engineering search team.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Who's excessive use of Open Geospatial technologies and centers as well as engagement with projects and communities like open addresses and Open Street Map.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Tom, can you please tell us a bit more about yourself.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Yeah, of course.</p>

<p>Thank dead.</p>

<p>It's a real pleasure to be here.</p>

<p>So yeah, as you mentioned, I've done a bunch of things and Matt Bach yesterday was my six year anniversary here actually include everything from meeting the Tom Lee: engineering team that works on our search engine to product work on the Mac side to being had a policy last couple of years just focused on interaction standards bodies and government Tom Lee: Before this, I was CTO Sunlight Foundation transparency already to nonprofit in the US that focus heavily on advocacy for open data, which is kind of the path that led me here.</p>

<p>So, Tom Lee: It's been a thrill to learn what the geospatial world is like and how it connects to the larger world of open knowledge.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So as I mentioned, Ted Guild: I'll keep an eye on the chat window if there's questions from the audience.</p>

<p>I feel there's time we'll take them.</p>

<p>Now, last night, save them towards the end.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: We have Ted Guild: Our esteemed panelists have a mix of experiences backgrounds.</p>

<p>Some cases veterans and geospatial area and you know there's including myself that new to this area and are, I believe, table has much more experience and geospatial than, than I do.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: And what I like to see is what lessons we have learned and future of mapping on the web and Ted Guild: Including for fresh perspectives, you know, in case of people are so new, this Ted Guild: Tell us a few things that are you feel are worth sharing about where you see mapping.</p>

<p>Now, or you think Ted Guild: Things we can learn from historically where you like to go Ted Guild: Since Ted Guild: no particular order.</p>

<p>If someone feels like jumping in, feel free.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I'll just call on someone sort of a ad hoc kind of thing.</p>

<p>And it's a said, feel free to sort of read a lot you know interchange and interact with each other as we go.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: I'd be happy to.</p>

<p>I mean if folks don't mind.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: I apologize.</p>

<p>Everyone else here.</p>

<p>I had put together a slide deck, because I totally screwed up trying to connect before this, I've got this whole thing loaded in my head.</p>

<p>I just got to get it out, but I will be brief.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: So there are three things that I wanted to try and convey to this audience in the hopes that can inform the work is being done by the group.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: The first, I think, is that there's there's reason for better sense of optimism about interoperability in the mapping world than I've seen in some of the materials presented so far.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: I have some blinders on here because I'm really proud of the work that matte box is done in the open on these questions, but I do want to underscore the fact that there are is a universe of open standards either like admirably open Tom Lee: Then God's standards bodies or just de facto ones like shape file that are sort of the PDF or Word docs of the universe that everyone can read, but it's exactly happy about.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: You know, my colleagues Jon Gillies got geo JSON through the IDF process standard the map box back fertile spec is used by lots of organizations, including open layers like Andreas just presented Tom Lee: Is an open spec and available to all.</p>

<p>And in general, I think that there is like a bit less of lock in and has been reported here, I would encourage people to check out the awesome vector tiles repo on GitHub, which lists a ton of different open projects and Tom Lee: vendors that are using the, the standard Tom Lee: The second thing I want to focus on is just like trying to underscore the fact that Tom Lee: Maps and tiles in particular, and the technology behind the classic pre processing versus runtime trade off and people need to bear that in mind as we're considering technologies.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: To address this problem of use cases there's a baseline of basically 60 frames per second cross platform performance.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: As well as bandwidth efficiency that have to be mad if any work coming out of just going to be relevant, and that has to be cross platform.</p>

<p>I'm afraid we Tom Lee: restrict ourselves to web browsers on desktop using.</p>

<p>I'm like, Tom Lee: Raster tiles are at one end of this where you can do a lot of pre computation but Loose kind of flexibility vector tiles are at the other end and their various points along the spectrum.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Where you can make different choices.</p>

<p>The industry is that vector tiles now and I would strongly suggest folks.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: You know the raster tiles are still an essential part of the picture.</p>

<p>If we're talking about imagery bass players are some types of pre processing, but Tom Lee: They're not where the action is right now and really vector tiles and particular rendering on GPU is where the industry is and where work needs to be done to push things forward.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: And then the final point I'll make is that I think there's a real important need for batteries included approach to any proposal that comes out.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Web or sorry, I do data big Tom Lee: Our map box street style set which is a small sort of highway use case oriented tile said Tom Lee: It's like comparable to what you would want in your, your, you know, Google Maps application is at least 400 gigabytes with with train data closer to 100 Tom Lee: And our satellite imagery layer is measured in petabytes, this is not stuff that's going to ship with a Firefox download thoughts need to be given to Tom Lee: How users who want the ease of the HTML authoring experience and deserve it, are going to get that Tom Lee: There is a need for some level central nation, for instance authoritative miss Tom Lee: For dealing with licensing across to data.</p>

<p>And in general, I think, to make this max like compelling.</p>

<p>Got to get beyond throwing a simple vector data set that fits in a geo JSON file into a browser.</p>

<p>It's unfortunately pretty far from where Meaningful Use cases are Ted Guild: Some more that unpack some more than a little bit more later on.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: You'll notice Ted Guild: Daniel.</p>

<p>Anyone else want to jump in on this one.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): And I don't disagree with anything from that said there is, I think, from interoperability point of view.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): There are there are enough Spanish to make sure that the the very kind of building blocks that we need to sort of build solutions now and into the Ed Parsons (Google): medium term future.</p>

<p>I mostly their work to do, but I think sometimes we need to sort of step back and say, well, Ed Parsons (Google): Actually, what are we trying to do you know what is a map fundamentally is is a communication tool for displaying a particular message difficult communicating something that is relevant to us.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): And that's going to change on a minute by minute, second by second basis, depending on the message.</p>

<p>We're trying to communicate.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): That in itself is only a small part of the broader geospatial industry and, you know, many cases the solution system just facial processing might be a yes no decision, it might be a cell that you put into a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): If anything we've we've learned over the last 20 years is that geospatial industry is very diverse indeed you know the the presentations, we've seen over the last week or so.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): In this workshop.</p>

<p>We're seeing huge diversity of different applications.</p>

<p>People are trying to do.</p>

<p>So I guess my initial point is around focus, I think, to make Ed Parsons (Google): Geospatial information on the web in the browser, a better citizen, we might need to focus quite finally on a limited number of use cases where we get the maximum benefit because there's a huge breadth of things that you probably don't want to standardize at this point in time.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): But there were some core things perhaps around, you know, simple static map this way.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): That would give us initial early benefit and will allow us to move forward and there's just such a diversity.</p>

<p>I think that that that focus that product management approach is really important.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Your, your audience.</p>

<p>Daniel: Yeah.</p>

<p>Again, I can't really disagree with anything that's already been said here anymore, the things it's Daniel: Totally mentioned, it was a lot more being done and exciting things and just kind of like during geo JSON and about a lot.</p>

<p>It's a lot of what I actually do in my Daniel: Day to day work but like how many smarter, better ways to integrate Daniel: That kind of data with the actual vector motels for our customers is something that like I definitely want going forward.</p>

<p>And there are cases where Daniel: We need smarter ways to be able to do that because even sometimes we're able to show, for example, the NAACP representation of our Daniel: Customers data in an anonymized way, but we can't actually share the data itself and there's no easy way to do that.</p>

<p>I'm going to just overlaying geo JSON on a map.</p>

<p>So having better integrated wasted and admittedly generate that and such is Daniel: Something that I would be excited about going forward, for sure.</p>

<p>And then, yeah.</p>

<p>Again, I can't disagree with anything that is as well about the dynamic nature of the space that different array of products and applications.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: Yeah, thank you.</p>

<p>So I'm I'm completely aligned with all the speakers.</p>

<p>See, and around, and I think it's a super heterogeneous space where we are currently moving through so Johannes Lauer: I think it's just the peak of the ice cube that we scratched with mainly visualizations and some small things of mapping.</p>

<p>When you look backwards.</p>

<p>So the whole thing about cartography, which has been made over Johannes Lauer: decades and centuries, more or less.</p>

<p>You see how you combine the maps and now with the maps for the web.</p>

<p>It is changing.</p>

<p>It's getting more dynamically, but you need all this Johannes Lauer: Visually visualizations to represent the informations to have a better decision making process, make it faster.</p>

<p>And besides that you're getting Johannes Lauer: A super heterogeneous set of data, which is coming in that you need to process within a very short time and present this to Johannes Lauer: The decision makers at the end.</p>

<p>And I think there will be an evolution, which will be yeah probably faster than it was within the last year and the Johannes Lauer: Request for standardized inputs and and yeah very yeah maybe agnostic way of working with with data and different data sets to represent this data to Johannes Lauer: Be had a whole heterogeneous set of decision makers from politicians to engineers to researchers and so on, and also for software engineers to handle the data.</p>

<p>I think it's, it's quite broad.</p>

<p>And we definitely need a broad set of tools for that.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So, thank you.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Something that Ted Guild: Certainly use for touch upon was sort of the openness of data salaries this from commercial interests, including your own Ted Guild: Because costs are considerable you want us to protect those assets and quite a few of you.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Are your companies are finally since we're opening them up in various ways and forums, not just the customers but for other purposes.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: We also sort of often hear of silos existing within organizations as well where different departments only know how to open up and share data with each other people take a very narrow specific Ted Guild: Focus on a given problem.</p>

<p>And don't think about how to architect and engineer data for for future openness and your opera ability Ted Guild: So like to sort of hear some of your experiences.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: In that and part of it is also where the benefits of open data.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: I know that Ted Guild: There's been several cases where people, some of the panelists companies here have been extremely helpful and in helping various disasters.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: As far as looking data in real time making available for emergency responders and governments and where it's just sort of realized the impact and sort of really sort of target their focuses Ted Guild: Far as this will probably expect to see more of with climate change and all the various qualifiers.</p>

<p>We're seeing increased so Ted Guild: There's a lot of information that Ted Guild: Is being collected that can be harnessed and leveraging shared and very useful and meaningful way.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So just Ted Guild: In general, maybe a bit about Ted Guild: transfers the silos, open up Ted Guild: The benefits for open up, including my the sort of mentioning as far as basically helping helping our fellow citizens of the Spanish get a little bit about your experiences and thoughts.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Is your highest had the pleasure of last name calling on him first.</p>

<p>But let's let people search something.</p>

<p>I don't know if he's screaming too much, but your camera salon in front of me.</p>

<p>So Johannes Lauer: All right.</p>

<p>Yeah, we can start with it.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: And it would start with, and quite famous sentence which you probably all know so the whole thing is more than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p>So when I think that's the motivation so that the sentences from Aristo to this.</p>

<p>It's quite famous Johannes Lauer: And if you're having in mind all this research project, for example, within the European Union, you have, for example, this horizon 2020 programs.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: They are companies research institutes NGOs governmental institutions and so on are getting partly funded to do some projects together, which is partly research focus.</p>

<p>Focus more innovation focus, but also for building new ways of Johannes Lauer: Getting money building new businesses and so on.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: So when you see how companies are working so Johannes Lauer: Not having the whole thing of a solution for potential customers, but also being in one boat within with several competitors and trying to find a solution.</p>

<p>I think Johannes Lauer: The cake of the geospatial stuff is increasing and it will be increasing for the next years or even decades, because we are still in exploring the things Johannes Lauer: So I think we, together, you will probably get more than you will get alone within your own business and it will widen the scope and with this interoperability is for sure one one key part and also within our Johannes Lauer: Our panelists here.</p>

<p>So there.</p>

<p>Yeah, at least two other competitors of fear in this panel is where we have like the same fields of businesses but I definitely think that every competitor has its, its own yeah focus and specialties that we can bring into Johannes Lauer: Yeah, solve customer needs at the end.</p>

<p>And I think this is something that needs to be explored.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Thomas Maybe Daniel: Yeah, I can jump in there.</p>

<p>Daniel: I mean yeah interoperability is kind of like a key thing going to all of us.</p>

<p>Of course, I mean, you, you mentioned a couple of things.</p>

<p>When you were talking there, Ted.</p>

<p>Also, I was told by Mike is quiet.</p>

<p>So someone yell at me if it's still too quiet.</p>

<p>I'm just trying to get closer to it here.</p>

<p>Daniel: One of the things you mentioned was going to like social good and that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Like, that's something that we tried to do a lot of times we actually have a portal where we release a whole bunch of just open source data sets.</p>

<p>And then there's a few reasons for that.</p>

<p>Daniel: It's not entirely selfless one is like, it's an interesting kind of like business, Rob, but also, we find that like putting data out kind of builds up Daniel: A couple things.</p>

<p>One is just like partnerships and ideas of like better ways to use our data and interesting things that we can do.</p>

<p>Part of it is also just like Daniel: As you mentioned, this disaster.</p>

<p>So our devices.</p>

<p>The plug into vehicles.</p>

<p>They have an onboard gyroscopes accelerometers, so you know when tremor start happening we're able to measure that.</p>

<p>Daniel: From from earthquakes and vehicles and when the Daniel: Mexico one app.</p>

<p>And I think was last year, the year before we able to detect that and the aftershocks and stuff and pinpoint areas that were that were hit harder and Daniel: Likewise with hurricanes and stuff.</p>

<p>And we release all of that and the ability for decision makers to quickly go in and get access to that kind of data.</p>

<p>Daniel: Present it make decisions based on it.</p>

<p>So that's come up a couple times and presentations like ultimately the point of this stuff is Daniel: The human is looking at it and wants to do something actionable make a decision.</p>

<p>Go somewhere decide on some policy change something, so having the ability to quickly iterate on that and product ties things is really important.</p>

<p>Daniel: And then another thing that was brought up was was siloed so that definitely happens even within geotab here.</p>

<p>We've got a lot of different departments.</p>

<p>Daniel: Some of which are newer older there's legacy systems.</p>

<p>There's a lot of interoperability things over the last few years, we've migrated.</p>

<p>Most of our services internally on to the Google Cloud Platform.</p>

<p>And actually, last year.</p>

<p>Daniel: BBQ GIS came out.</p>

<p>So we use Big Query as our data warehousing environment and they added native geospatial support into Big Query.</p>

<p>Daniel: So I've been told and departments at different ways of kind of story and and managing the geospatial information.</p>

<p>Daniel: In different ways of trying to visualize that and play with it but just the fact of just baking in that standard into the tool that everybody uses Daniel: Now, like, by default, if your geospatial data is in the query.</p>

<p>I know it's in the right format because it's natively supported Daniel: And that made it a lot easier to just communicate and save share data across the departments that we have here.</p>

<p>So baking these standards and immediately starts to break down the silos least in my experience.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Yeah, so I, I, one of the things that attracted me to map box is the kind of humanitarian folks have talked back here, the factory Open Street Map team does amazing work activity.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: In the wake of disasters and we've been we've been privileged to help to arrange donations that imagery from partners like backs are Tom Lee: Formerly digital globe, but, you know, in some ways that's like, that's an outlier.</p>

<p>I think that there is a more predictable process by which data gets open Tom Lee: When I was running the search team at map box.</p>

<p>Our coin of the realm was addressed data points.</p>

<p>That's what we really need to provide accurate to codes for end users for a lot of important use cases.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: And, you know, of course, the first thing we do is go around individual governments and see if they have them available on their Open Data Portal is really interesting to learn Tom Lee: Sort of where the dividing line and density was Tom Lee: You know, highly populous and economically successful areas typically have these points available for download or you get them easily enough Tom Lee: And then more remote places that were focused on extractive industries oil and gas timber, stuff like that.</p>

<p>You'd have to send in a check and then they burn you and DVD wrong or whatever.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Or they just didn't have the data at all.</p>

<p>And, you know, this makes sense if you think about just in terms of infrastructure, if you are trying to build a road into remote wilderness to service the property you by your desk pay somebody to do it.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: But it's a socialized cost downtown to maintain the roads because it doesn't make sense to Tom Lee: You know, send everybody a bill individually except as part of their taxes.</p>

<p>It's a piece of infrastructure, everyone can use and people, you know, Tom Lee: If I better understanding of the same holds true for geospatial data, which is great.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: It means that we can expect the open offerings around the world to keep getting better and better.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: And partly, that's the look of governments and partly it's the work of dedicated volunteers.</p>

<p>I just dropped a link in chat to the Open Street Map specific page.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: And you'll see like, you know, there's millions of nodes getting added every single day to this project.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Now there are other challenges to connect one familiar to anybody who follows Wikipedia interesting culture also fighting and the welcoming this new contributors and there's also questions about new types of data.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: You know, the classic use case of tracing roads and buildings from satellite imagery is something that anybody can do from there armchair at any point in the world.</p>

<p>It's harder to map turn restrictions.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Or other more subtle types of data that require additional data sets aren't available in the open.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Or what your frankly just really tedious require a lot of technical knowledge to do.</p>

<p>I think there's also open questions about different types of mapping that are being done that rely on Tom Lee: GPS sensor traces.</p>

<p>There is a capability to upload that go with them, but the large scale collection of stuff to do things like detect real time traffic conditions.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Nobody's yet figured out how to do this safely and totally open way because there's really important privacy considerations and economies of scale that you have to Tom Lee: Cross that mean that commercial entities or governmental ones are really the ones that are in the best position to solve these problems.</p>

<p>So Tom Lee: There are some real challenges related to sort of the next frontier for spatial data, how are we going to get the street level imagery on an open basis refreshed frequently enough to be relevant.</p>

<p>How are we going to get a truly navigable Tom Lee: fully open road graph, but, you know, in general, the trend toward open.</p>

<p>This has been great.</p>

<p>And I think it's really super powered, a lot of the industry and businesses with people on this call.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): Yeah.</p>

<p>Again, it's hard to sort of disagree, although I think there probably are.</p>

<p>If we honest limits that openness, I think, by all means.</p>

<p>So the direction of travel is towards greater that was an openness, because it reduces friction that allows us to Ed Parsons (Google): Incorporate allows us to break those silos down.</p>

<p>And when we choose to share data, it makes sharing more valuable.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): But I think we also have to recognize that there you know there are business models around adding value to data sets to Ed Parsons (Google): I've created creating processes algorithms that use data to produce another product in other service and we need to recognize that they will curry list.</p>

<p>And now the green I sort of Ed Parsons (Google): I suppose example I use.</p>

<p>I had a call earlier on today with some people in the UK who are building an open data portal for buses national bus routes and so Ed Parsons (Google): Many, many years ago, a few years ago and GFS was created as a open standards for people that wanted to publish bustling public transit information is now used across the industry by many vendors.</p>

<p>It's a mechanism by which if you choose to make data available.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): It's a way that you can do that in a standardized fashion and it allows an ecosystem to then develop around that where app developers can build their apps that you know if you are passenger Ed Parsons (Google): If you get information about how well your buses running.</p>

<p>If you're a provider of services to the bus operator, you can build them an app that Ed Parsons (Google): That consumes in danger and ads you know their own management information as well.</p>

<p>So it's those examples where you can identify Ed Parsons (Google): Is a case where everyone wants to get access to very similar data can we put in place a mechanism that Ed Parsons (Google): meets the needs of 80% of that community and then allows those ecosystems to develop around that now allows you know some companies, if they wish to to to be commercial and make money.</p>

<p>I wanted Ted Guild: To touch on a few things that Ted Guild: For this topic that a sort of come across Ted Guild: Certainly for both internally and Ted Guild: For Exposing dates others in the importance of standards is one thing I heard trying to settle on some core technologies.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Were 10 models.</p>

<p>There's the government entities were mentioned, there are some the richest producers of open data sets, for sure.</p>

<p>There's also quite a bit of Ted Guild: researchers that have taken a Ted Guild: Tax dollars, you know, public funds but if otherwise for encumbered their results.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: For various reasons.</p>

<p>And as we sort of mentioned there's even though love commercial providers are are exposing some of their data, there's some things that they're keeping close Ted Guild: Themselves, but it seems like Ted Guild: There needs to be Ted Guild: Some way to have sort of open understanding of what data is available out there, even if it's under restricted terms and it may be sort of volte multiple licensing capabilities for research purposes if you Ted Guild: Are using this data set and what you have to do as far as giving back for like a like a Ted Guild: Like Apache Software license kind of thing, or what have you, or Ted Guild: No commercial interest you know where you're doing the value as you'd be making money off of this data, what you should be giving back know if if you're getting commercial data source or they're Ted Guild: They're sort of things along these lines that can can maybe Ted Guild: Help us to sort of figure out how to make people aware of what's available in trying to Ted Guild: normalize the concept of catalogs and exchanges.</p>

<p>There are some various efforts.</p>

<p>I know.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: National Research Council of Canada is doing a big project and that where they're trying to build huge catalogs data lakes is their kind.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Of private and public sector data and not sure how much that is being used and mirrored and model for elsewhere, but if people have knowledge of things like that or ideas on Ted Guild: What we can try to do better there in order to pivot and find data.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Proactively instead of, you know, when there's a crisis or when there's a business need or generate revenue streams additional revenue streams for your company's these sort of things.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): I think I'm a bit of a radical in this position, and now I know great fan of data castle and for the traditional approach that we've taken as a geospatial industry for Ed Parsons (Google): separating out the content and the metadata, we've had the meta data catalogs, we've gone down the route of creating quite sophisticated and schemas for describing geospatial content which he would go to a specialized so that Ed Parsons (Google): Come up with the query language to negotiate with that.</p>

<p>So that, and you might identify that someday says exists somewhere.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): But as a result of that, like a result of that, in many ways, artificial separation between content and the metadata about their content.</p>

<p>It's been hard to access information that is useful and this is actionable.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): Unfortunately, I think, you know, things are changing.</p>

<p>You see, you see things like the stack and you see Ed Parsons (Google): The direct process, the dregs publishing of raster data sets.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): In a much more accessible form where you actually are tying the meta data to the actual data itself and with a traditional search paradigm to try and Ed Parsons (Google): Query across those data sets and to pass them in that way.</p>

<p>It's making geospatial information more mainstream more like any other basis that was published on on the web.</p>

<p>And now, indeed, we're beginning to have those initial Ed Parsons (Google): forays into a link stage or approach to geospatial information coming up with better semantics to understand how we published you especially those that I think Ed Parsons (Google): Where we need to do to move forward again you know is I guess that was my message is, we need to be more mainstream.</p>

<p>We need to be much more standard citizens of the web as opposed to creating our own separate Geospatial web where we did things differently.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: Us.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: Step and This is Johannes Lauer: I think the one thing is making the information available and kind of searchable.</p>

<p>The other thing is to make it digestible and Johannes Lauer: Make it easy to evaluate this information for for consumers for users of the data.</p>

<p>So you need to figure out, okay, is this data usable is does it have and if fitness for my use case is the for example the road network that is available by governmental institution or by n.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: Matte box or by and here by Open Street Map itself by Google, or whatever, who is the supplier is this fitting to my use case and having this in an kind of standardized way and Johannes Lauer: Making it easy for the consumer to evaluate the data.</p>

<p>I think in many use cases even consumers do not know about the requirements for the use case.</p>

<p>And there is in in many things not standard way to evaluate the quality you have spatial data.</p>

<p>Daniel: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>And just have Tom Lee: A good idea.</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>So Daniel: And yeah, just having the data available is like just very simple and first step and that I mean like Statistics Canada.</p>

<p>And like other thing other websites in the US and Daniel: Abroad have lots of data kind of these little data lakes that they've just sort of dumped their from historical uses because they've gotten the mandate to do that, but not all of it as high quality, not all of it is useful.</p>

<p>Daniel: Most of it is not accessible with an API or any simple method.</p>

<p>So like Daniel: I've got a team of interns running around trying to scrape like open data from all these open data portals and then spend weeks, getting it into our Daniel: Environment and then visualize it and then see half of it is useless.</p>

<p>Like there's no easy way to get all that or to understand its utility after until like a lot of work has been put into it.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Yeah, I think.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: One of the reasons why I get very excited about some of the ideas around distributed tiles that had been discussed in earlier presentations.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: But it's hard for me to see it working.</p>

<p>What do you suggest trying to, I think, for me, occasionally right into right where we can see a customer maybe wants to render map box tiles and route again tear tiles and that can lead to really weird behaviors.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Even just using or Sam by itself, you kind of need to know which version canonical you're pulling down, you've got to have workflows to watch for vandalism.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: And, you know, other ways of correcting bugs, since it is a widely used database.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: One other thing I'll say I'm sorry that I will always go back to address points by example, but probably should all just resign yourself to that.</p>

<p>The next 30 minutes Tom Lee: Is the opening dresses project.</p>

<p>So there are a ton of governments in the publishing address point data, a lot of them have decided to invent their own data licenses, which is not super helpful to be perfectly honest.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Others are aiming for compatibility or spoken street apps open database license, which is Tom Lee: Great because they are doing it took and get into them in practice their political, cultural legal obstacles to Tom Lee: Simply import.</p>

<p>They're imagining and only BL not really used by anybody else has some flaws and has never been tested in court.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: So that tuition is not great, and you wind up with then standards bodies writing these gigantic hundreds of pages long XML documents about address specs that nobody uses Tom Lee: And instead, their efforts like open addressing this again.</p>

<p>I'm biased here, you know, a few volunteers going out, finding the URLs of the dataset.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Writing simple little JSON snippets would say, Okay, this is what they called Tom Lee: The latitude column is what the company wants to call this is the projection that seems to be in Tom Lee: This is whether it requires attribution, whether it's share like or whether none of that is required and you're still going to have your own lawyer to go through all this stuff, but Tom Lee: The output of our system is big CSV that you can import and you don't have to do this for every county in the US for, you know, every department in their friends.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: And that's, like, that's the reality of what you actually have to do to use this data, putting it up on to Tom Lee: Government website with a bunch of metadata is one thing and you can get yourself on the back for a job well done.</p>

<p>But for any user who's use case extends beyond your borders.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: I think that more attention to opera ability would be really welcome and would deliver a lot of value to your citizen users.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So the geospatial or especially in the web is your scripts we reach our dream.</p>

<p>They're taking up overhauling the Ted Guild: Especially the web, best practices, talking to and just, you know, making opportunity to Ted Guild: Without something that is not, not, you know, a confusing standard that known adopts and does involve the various stakeholders and no one finds out about it.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: And won't get there.</p>

<p>Hopefully there's ways that we can try to improve where it is and prove create some baselines.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Maybe an opportunity so that work is is kicking off right now.</p>

<p>So that's an opportunity and focusing a lot on on data and sort of apologies.</p>

<p>I guess where that this maps in the workshop.</p>

<p>This is the content that's going in, in behind it.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: And, you know, extremely sort of valuable necessary, is it is there is a wealth of information out there, but it's Ted Guild: Hearing and heard in the past how unusual it is, and a lot of cases.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: And greed know, to the extent that you can keep things simple.</p>

<p>So because you have to keep in mind the multitude of audiences producing this information.</p>

<p>If you can sort of boil it down to something Ted Guild: You know, kind of treading even here CSP in this day and age, but you know it is it is a Ted Guild: Is a common denominator is something that people can produce and readily and you don't have to submit as you every government entities, you know, Ted Guild: Told to open up this data in some format and their eyes will get cross reference how if we can find if we can give them some some basic guidance.</p>

<p>Some ways to do that.</p>

<p>That would be a huge help.</p>

<p>And then hopefully be able to increase it from there.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: We have a question.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: From Krell about Lucy user feedback.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So the special on the web group is as part of that.</p>

<p>So I guess I react to your question with the partial response.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: As far as what the OCC community itself is doing.</p>

<p>But as far as the Ted Guild: SI joint committee which especially in that group.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: But other other people either panelists were in the audience that can maybe speak a little bit to that as far as what sort of feedback.</p>

<p>You're hearing on on on geospatial data in general and it's for openness.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): Well, I mean, I can speak from an agency point of view, being a director at least on the board of directors.</p>

<p>So as you see that there's a big is a big change for the AGC in the past.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): I'd say two years probably where there is now a focus of becoming much more developer friendly in terms of building Ed Parsons (Google): API that are again more standardized using swagger open API as a design principal and making sure that you're much more on the Ed Parsons (Google): Activity happens in the open so you see much more work now happening in GitHub and Ed Parsons (Google): It allows you a hopefully a more more open process.</p>

<p>And, you know, there are still challenges there as you see traditionally has been dominated by your large government agencies.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): I think we go, do you see as an organization needs to work hard to sort of broaden it its appeal to that that wider community of users are geospatial data.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): As opposed to produce it, that's, I guess where the the balance needs to shift a bit, but I would hope the most people on this call to DC now as a as a more open organization, then it was perhaps in the past.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Servants received, but through similar transition while ago.</p>

<p>And so, you know, this is always a balancing act and both workstations are similar in there.</p>

<p>The revenue models, you know, being membership.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): I think it is it is a recognition that it's Ed Parsons (Google): It's more than the technology.</p>

<p>It's about bringing communities together you know Tom made a really good point about, you know, openness.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): And around the complexity of licenses and I think there's still a lot of work that we need to do to come up with Ed Parsons (Google): You know, a robust form of data licensing that parallels.</p>

<p>What we do with with software development, you know, we know Ed Parsons (Google): What an Apache License age, we know what a G bail licenses.</p>

<p>We don't have the same level of granularity when it comes to how we process.</p>

<p>You know, we publish data.</p>

<p>So I think there's still more work to be done that.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Recently, the question Creative Commons licenses, maybe more.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Hands, not a lawyer, thankfully.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Anyone else Ted Guild: Have sort of thoughts on on this this particular Ted Guild: question or topic and present.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think this is a super Johannes Lauer: Important point.</p>

<p>So, and it's definitely comparable to the things that you do have in the software industry.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: And you need to figure out when when you shipping software to a customer, you need to have an license compliance, so in many software products, there's life.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: 80% of the software is open source.</p>

<p>And you have the whole bunch of software licenses.</p>

<p>And the same would Johannes Lauer: Be the case for geographic data sets and it would be even more complicated and having a look at all the open database or open data license models that you have Johannes Lauer: At least here for Germany and for all over Europe.</p>

<p>I think in Germany every Federal, State has its own open data license for the Johannes Lauer: data sets that are given by their governmental institutions by each municipality and so on that.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: Yeah, super mess of licenses and data.</p>

<p>And if you want to make use of that and harmonize this this data for an end to end routing.</p>

<p>It's a across Europe or across all over the world that is getting super complicated Johannes Lauer: And you need to have an homogeneous handling of this licenses of the data formats and so on.</p>

<p>And if you then implement on top and as an in between layer.</p>

<p>For example, a routing engine or search engine.</p>

<p>You need to digest this data you need to take care on the Johannes Lauer: Different license model and this is at the end.</p>

<p>This is the business that you're is doing for roughly 35 years by providing this for our motors.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: In such a case.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: I'm Chris little provided a another answer.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: To this question saying that, uh, Ted Guild: Maybe she's talking about the OC Santa for user feedback and provide the link which will be Ted Guild: I will make sure it's part of the Minutes proceedings and it's currently in, zoom chat.</p>

<p>Thank you, Chris.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So look at the clock and Ted Guild: We still plenty of time.</p>

<p>But a try and get back to Ted Guild: GIS data is going to drive out to the web is providing the content and Ted Guild: But what are some business use cases that Ted Guild: Pertain to your companies as far as what you'd like to see this.</p>

<p>This effort as many community address that will help Ted Guild: Help you become stakeholders in this activity help you help try and shape that help with sort of considerations.</p>

<p>Would you like to try and get Ted Guild: Them to think, think of a price.</p>

<p>What are some of the cost benefits for you instead of having to if you can use the web browser as your, your interface your end customers.</p>

<p>Does that reduce your costs, you know, if you're leveraging the more the web stack instead of Ted Guild: Doing proprietary interfaces, for example.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: What sort of we've had quite a bit of presentations and panels on accessibility enhancements, which is extremely important part of maps little white.</p>

<p>How do you make Ted Guild: How do you currently make Ted Guild: Your mapping solutions accessible or try to Ted Guild: See that the the importance of open standards for harmonize approach for helping increase the accessibility of mapping on on the web.</p>

<p>So what are some like Ted Guild: Business cases or or things that you think may influence this Ted Guild: This effort to sensitivity ways that you can maybe bring it back within your companies and help make the argument for why they should be involved, kind of thing.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Well PR is unlocking performance is really important.</p>

<p>There's always more that we would like to do to enable more flexibility on the client side and we're really bounded by what's possible.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: And this gets down to the nitty gritty of browser implementation.</p>

<p>So this is less standards work than just getting the implementations.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: This was alluded to, and Andreas in his presentation on open layers and some of the constraints, they're facing using off screen canvases.</p>

<p>I've run into, you know, varying Tom Lee: differences in how the performance Resource Timing API is implemented web workers across browsers which interfered with some of our benchmarking.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: That's like, that's pretty deep.</p>

<p>I would say it's hard to find very many tickets about this stuff being broken Tom Lee: But that's really important.</p>

<p>Moving to a native implementation could really unlock some additional performance.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: But it's going to have to be at the leading edge and in turn that performance is going to open up Tom Lee: new capabilities for doing stuff on the client.</p>

<p>Like, I think I spoke to dismissively of the idea of throwing geo Jason at Tom Lee: On top of the map that is like an incredibly flexible and powerful use case.</p>

<p>And if your data is small enough to do it that way.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: You can do more with the data in that form, then basically anything else.</p>

<p>The problem is that it's not performance when you start adding too much.</p>

<p>And so you have to do pre processing and details or other optimizations, you have to Tom Lee: You know, rather than relying on the lovely vector drawing API as it exists in the browser, you have to try and flying triangles Web GL right now.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Anything that can be done to unlock more performance will push the frontier forward and standardization can be part of that, then that's really great.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Anyone else want to speak on that one.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): Yeah.</p>

<p>Daniel: Percent like a lot of a lot of this stuff there go really close my microphone for me in the chat.</p>

<p>So he getting complaints, um, Daniel: Yeah, a lot of this stuff that we're doing now, we're like, we're coming up with workarounds around performance constraints likes there's stuff that we could be doing with we have petabytes of Daniel: Movement data from vehicles like there's a ton of stuff we are doing and could do with that, but there's only so much stuff that we can put on a map with like, you know, Geo JSON rendering on top of Daniel: Raster tiles as soon as we get to like a couple of million points using like current implementations.</p>

<p>It just grinds to a halt, especially because most of the renderings happening on the user side.</p>

<p>Daniel: And there's only so much their computers can do, especially when we're working with public sector.</p>

<p>Daniel: Community.</p>

<p>So that's really a limiting factor.</p>

<p>And then, I mean, you mentioned the accessibility.</p>

<p>So I actually just had a call this morning.</p>

<p>We've got a mandate internally and make sure Daniel: Every single one of our products is align with the odd Ada, which is the Ontario, where I live, province for Daniel: Disability stuff.</p>

<p>There's the ADA stuff, etc.</p>

<p>Kind of Daniel: How do we do that with with all of the novel like mapping representations that we're coming up with smart cities is not an easy thing.</p>

<p>It's not something that's really standardized right now.</p>

<p>So that's going to be a challenge for us, for sure.</p>

<p>Daniel: And then the other thing is just kind of coming back to interoperability or working with a lot of cities that got different data different legacy systems different ways that they want to look at things and Daniel: If I've generated data sets, for example, with Open Street Map and they want to see it kind of projected onto Google Maps and somebody else wants to see it.</p>

<p>Daniel: Rounded with here or something.</p>

<p>There's like a lot of different interoperability considerations, even in just visualizing this that I currently struggle with.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): I don't look at it from a different perspective.</p>

<p>You know, I look at yeah web pages as a source of data and you know let's take for example.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): A location or buy a business or hotel or shopping center you to web page or which there may be a map presented on it.</p>

<p>But certainly, don't be textual description.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): Of the address.</p>

<p>Maybe the opening hours when I became of is you know better semantic tagging of that content on the page so that your Ed Parsons (Google): Screen reader can read the address that they have the semantic understanding that in this case.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): This particular store is in Ottawa, which is in Ontario, which is in Canada, then you can you ask Kevin dialogue with an intelligent assistant and understood that content as geospatial information understood the geo spatial relationships that were presented that and could almost do that.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): without reference to the map because the map, by its very nature is a very visual representation.</p>

<p>If we can Ed Parsons (Google): Have that same content expressed in other ways mean the geospatial ideas behind that information also presented Ed Parsons (Google): I think that's going to give as many other opportunities in the future, not just from an accessibility point of view, but from, you know, the machine to machine processing of this data moving forward.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: You won't have anything on this one or Ted Guild: No pressure, not Johannes Lauer: Yet fully true Johannes Lauer: agree with that.</p>

<p>Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: Think, maybe, maybe one point.</p>

<p>So, as we talked a little bit about your business model.</p>

<p>It's or what could accelerate this behavior and also just saw your turn, who Johannes Lauer: Put some some data into the chat of this massive database about licenses and license models which are available of this Johannes Lauer: Somehow open accessible data sets via mainly via Odyssey interfaces, but also by Sri proprietary interfaces.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: And I think this is definitely something where we need some some work on to clarify how this data can be used.</p>

<p>We do have on consumer side safety on use this data and building business models, maybe out of that and having as a consumer and the producer.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: The opportunity to yeah to to make money out of data and building businesses on top of that.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: If the provider of the data is not able to provide an exact license of the product which is yeah being yeah open for public Johannes Lauer: Then it's it's very unsecured to build a business case.</p>

<p>On top of that, because you don't know how the decision would be, and this is a layer which is needed to bring some safety into the market and this will also start thinking about the quality of data and figuring out what kind of Johannes Lauer: Attributes and variables are are needed to specify to describe the data, which would go probably beyond the meter data description which is currently available.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Sorry.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: To not I'm using my iPad for zoom and getting some way to meetings apologies for that.</p>

<p>I hope they're not coming through.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: They probably are.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So, Ted Guild: A big revenue and regulations are the two, the biggest motivations for for commercial interests.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Daniel mentioned ADA and the Canadian equivalent Ted Guild: And of course these similar things exist to you and I press the world and Ted Guild: It's this sort of drive home the point that i i feel about clearly a lot of our participants do Ted Guild: You know, it's part of this workshop, it's a sort of reminder necessity, you know, not direct the panelists, but to all attendees.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: That towards the day, it's not just protecting yourself from lawsuits for creating products.</p>

<p>They're not accessible as required by law.</p>

<p>It's also keeping in mind, a good portion of your audience, your customer base.</p>

<p>I had stats from a previous Ted Guild: Conversation.</p>

<p>I did with someone from the Web Accessibility Initiative about how pronounced Ted Guild: portion of the population has varying accessibility needs.</p>

<p>So you're just a reminder that you're sort of carry out a big piece of your, your customer demographic if you're not doing this at the outset, you're not thinking about it.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Response to the licensing as far as business use cases.</p>

<p>So we're talking sort of combines the earlier topic as far as data and trying to be able to license that you know people, you know, using an open web stack and making this so that Ted Guild: Maps for that maps to the web or our first class citizen, then you can sort of tailor your products.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: To be cheaper later and available and more platforms more readily and without having sort of port your, your custom interface because you know there'll be a browser runtime there.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: But it's also allowing opportunities to license, such as the data, some very services on top of it.</p>

<p>That does the value add to two other people who will be able to Ted Guild: To take your products to next step further or two specific target audience.</p>

<p>It's not just accessible.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Not just for accessibility means Ted Guild: So, uh, Ted Guild: Were some current technical challenges that you see that Ted Guild: It's kind of worse with the business use cases of Ted Guild: Any sort of Ted Guild: A technology challenges that you like to Ted Guild: We've, we've actually heard several throughout this.</p>

<p>So I guess the sword opportunity to express the additional ones that you like to try and get out there and Ted Guild: Can people's ears and minds as they're working on a map.</p>

<p>So the web.</p>

<p>What are some some things that you like to some challenges you face that you feel that Ted Guild: This community will, as well as they try to make mouse more prominent on the web, right, the Tom Lee: Lenny.</p>

<p>Lenny jumping ahead because you mentioned accessibility.</p>

<p>I just talked briefly say this is one of the reasons why I think it's really important for people to engage with vector tiles as the technology because they carry semantic content, not just Tom Lee: Rendered visual content where the raster tiles.</p>

<p>Do they can be inspected on the client side.</p>

<p>And you can do all kinds of things that make the map experience dramatically more accessible.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Just couple weeks ago I saw somebody dissertation cross my inbox and iOS app with extremely high contrast mode and tactile feedback to make the Tom Lee: Make the map vibrate when your finger crossing the road line for people with visual impairments and that's possible.</p>

<p>You know, using the exact same vector tiles, you might use to power a conventional display.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: So that's one of the things to make that technology really exciting still pages constraints.</p>

<p>So this is one of those things that I, you know, for all the hype.</p>

<p>I do think that we're going to see some exciting things five g and other Tom Lee: Technologies deployed because, you know, right now, our rule of thumb that we enforce is 500 kilobytes per tile.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: That limits how many languages, we can support for labels labels, the limits the precision of geometry limit to how many features we can include that.</p>

<p>And given zoom level.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: We're optimizing around this to try and balance the incredible power you can pack into one of these things using Google's protobuf technology.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: binary representation with a good experience over mobile networks and you know that's gonna that's gonna keep getting better.</p>

<p>I don't know that it's Tom Lee: I don't know everybody who's on the zoom and if any of them are responsible for the state of our wireless networks, but if you are.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>I think we're going to get better map fix to your efforts.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Plus for others.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): I guess my wish list if there is such a thing is is a better positioning technology we produce quite good solutions.</p>

<p>Now that work outside with a clear view of the scope Ed Parsons (Google): But we spend the at the moment we spend an awful lot of time indoors, where most of that technology stops working as well.</p>

<p>And we can't really do very well to transition between indoors and outdoors and particularly again from that accessibility pornography dealing with people with Ed Parsons (Google): limited vision, having accurate turn by turn directions delivered by by voice both outside, inside require us to be able to position ourselves down to Ed Parsons (Google): Less than the meter all of the time and there is no real technological solution for doing that at scale.</p>

<p>At this point in telling Ed Parsons (Google): There's work in progress.</p>

<p>I think in the next five years, we will come up with those solutions, but if we can solve that problem.</p>

<p>Now that that opens up a huge range of new applications that Ed Parsons (Google): There will be God.</p>

<p>The indoors as as as a geospatial where ground just as the same way to regroup regard the outside is just special realm.</p>

<p>I think it's a change of scale that we're operating at that.</p>

<p>I think that's going to be really, really exciting near future.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So I haven't been there a while over the status center.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: MIT, I should we got on to another building, but, um, it's a Frank Gehry building.</p>

<p>There's not a lot of Ted Guild: Straight lines in that place and they've tried with various NFC and other things to try and help people navigate, there's Ted Guild: Possibility last are spread all over the place, as well.</p>

<p>But it's such that Ted Guild: Indoors is normally a challenge.</p>

<p>And there's ways to make even more.</p>

<p>So there's a couple of groups that WPC we heard from the data for accessibility folks before.</p>

<p>There's also the link building data group that's looking to Ted Guild: They're actually more focused on building capabilities and let it sort of has to offer.</p>

<p>Then the internal and navigation, but the link for accessibility folks are trying to Ted Guild: Include data as far as what how to move within the building.</p>

<p>What is capabilities, our offerings, things like that.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So what are a few minutes left.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Give the audience, some opportunity to throw in some more questions.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: For us to sort of wrap up and.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, like Ted Guild: Were some new opportunities.</p>

<p>Some offerings that you see that Ted Guild: Include bass little webcam grains we personally sort of come up sort of already, but those were the last my topics on the list.</p>

<p>So Ted Guild: Any sort of Ted Guild: What do you see this this activity, possibly opening up as far as smart cities more sort of interoperability.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: multimodal transportation coordination.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Probably can travel again.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Various things like that, you know, anything sort of come to mind that sort of you think might be sort of Ted Guild: Among the various killer apps little helps her drive this the space where or Ted Guild: The shouldn't use curiosity.</p>

<p>Where's the big sort of bigger picture initiatives that can can really sort of benefit from this that that might come to mind.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: One.</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>Um, Tom Lee: I guess I would take it from the, from the other side, right, is that I think Tom Lee: They are simple use cases, it should be simpler and you don't necessarily have to bite off augmented reality or, you know, some of the stuff into the bleeding edge right like the there are a lot of people who want to do some simple automatic mapping or heat maps or, you know, or Tom Lee: Corn plants like things that it would be really nice if you don't understand the difference between like the natural data set.</p>

<p>And, you know, Tom Lee: What open layers versus we foot is to get up and running in your web browser stuff that you know the spammy W three schools links should cover.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: I think it would be great if we could preview clear that bar and make the basic and generally openly licensed ATM zero an ATM one geometry.</p>

<p>Tom Lee: Ship with browsers and ideally have like wiki data links so that people can tie into a semantic universe associated data and just make like the simple stuff.</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>I'll be really cool.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: A quick clarification three schools is not related to WC Ted Guild: We don't send a cease and desist way back in the 90s when they started Ted Guild: But anyway.</p>

<p>Day.</p>

<p>I will say, Ted Guild: That who's good stuff that you see this stuff that unless Ed Parsons (Google): Yeah, I agree with Tom I think just getting the simple things right.</p>

<p>What you know what appealed to me about this home maps HTML.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): Program and the work that Peter has been doing is, is actually making it even simpler than it is now.</p>

<p>You could argue, well over the past 10 or 15 years we've made.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): Maps in the web, much simpler they once were.</p>

<p>And, you know, but actually there's still a long way to go to make it as simple as possible.</p>

<p>And for most importantly for anyone, creating Ed Parsons (Google): A web site a web application doing anything in the browser to actually understand.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): That's a piece of geospatial content.</p>

<p>I know what that does.</p>

<p>I know how I can interact with that without Ed Parsons (Google): You know necessarily building the huge JavaScript libraries that we have at the moment, if there is a core amount of functionality to allow someone's put them up on a web page.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): Have basic interactivity and put a pin on that app that makes geospatial more mainstream.</p>

<p>That's what we should be aiming at.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Your house.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: She Ted Guild: Said GOING THAT QUESTION, SHOULD with closing remarks KIND OF THINGS FOR COMING UP TO THE TOP DOLLAR rather apathy, but you guys also a great opportunity to Ted Guild: put something out there as much everyone discourse links exists on on the agenda page in the minutes or so things as far as continuing the conversation.</p>

<p>Well, after this workshop Ted Guild: Daniel harnessing any sort of either.</p>

<p>So we're closing remarks are some ways that what the future hold, and what are some opportunities which are meant to be kind of that topic as well.</p>

<p>Daniel: So yeah, just, just briefly, I guess those pile into that and then that kind of feeds into your, your question.</p>

<p>Daniel: Like making things simpler going for.</p>

<p>It's like our business model is primarily through resellers like we realized early on we can't be all things to all people.</p>

<p>Daniel: Maps are really complicated and our end users can't really handle a lot of that on their own.</p>

<p>Our value like I think is in the data and the algorithms that we apply on top of that.</p>

<p>Daniel: We're not mapmakers we leverage maps to display that information to our customers.</p>

<p>And we have a whole team of people building interfaces for them to do that.</p>

<p>Daniel: For thurs simpler ways for our resellers to just ingest the data that we're generating for them and customize it to each of their own customers and we can be a lot more hands off on that.</p>

<p>Daniel: And as he's kind of standards involved to make that easier going forward.</p>

<p>We can redouble our efforts on what our core business model is and where our expertise is and less on building up these custom interfaces for end users.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Thanks honest.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: So yeah, briefly, my conclusion for the future would be making the interfaces and the interaction possibilities for end user customers.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: Is is a key thing that we you setting the the right leverage to make it easy for users that are not in the GI science or the geospatial Johannes Lauer: Community to step into that and make use of this data just make it easy and then let them explore the world because it's getting more complicated.</p>

<p>You, you see how Johannes Lauer: Drones are working with data, the IMU stuff.</p>

<p>The whole D Odyssey stuff which is super important for having high precise navigation.</p>

<p>Johannes Lauer: And having an understanding of the quality of the data and how useful it is for my use case.</p>

<p>What do I need, what, how, how should I evaluate the data for my special use case and the easy access to the Johannes Lauer: Let's say the first level.</p>

<p>This will open the door for the broad universe of geospatial content and Johannes Lauer: spatial temporal content at the end.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Tom Ed very a brief last parting words of wisdom beyond physic you're answering the question and Ted Guild: It sort of was along those lines as far as last steps and you kind of give that I can keep it simple, simple, for now, but there's any other Ted Guild: Pray things before we wrap up.</p>

<p>Ed Parsons (Google): Any, anything complicated things just keep it simple.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Keep it simple.</p>

<p>This is good, good, good thing.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: So, Tom Lee: Yeah we freed my my copies and me talking.</p>

<p>When I should have.</p>

<p>But yeah, I think, keeping it simple is a good place to start.</p>

<p>And I really encourage everyone to Tom Lee: Try and engage with the, I think that the open mapping community is not done as good of a job as it could have making clear how this stuff works to other web community with important exception.</p>

<p>I mean, I was delighted to see Yvonne here to see a Tom Lee: Period here that I know there's there's important amount of overlap but there's also like a lot of work that this effort, could be taking advantage of what's out there.</p>

<p>And yeah, I'm excited to see what the local NGOs.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Thank you all for the panel for your participation.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Policies might stop looking at the clock group because it was, you know, whether we're going around right out of time.</p>

<p>We've gone too far by a couple minutes.</p>

<p>Ted Guild: Peter Ted Guild: You want to be to hand back over to you and see if there's any reminders.</p>

<p>We want to make before we wrap up.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: No, but I just want to thank the panel for being such good sports and participating today.</p>

<p>It's great to engage the community and different mapping providers and so on, as Tom was Peter Rushforth: Mentioning there.</p>

<p>We've tried our best to keep it out in the open.</p>

<p>I mean, no we don't have a big publicity machine, but it's a community group.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: And we are welcoming of all contributions, large and small, so yeah, how to keep it simple is not as simple as one might imagine.</p>

<p>So definitely welcome contributions in that regard.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: And with that, I guess we should move on to our next part of our program today, which is a breakout session that's going to be led by Carol char got the game about their whiteboard application technology for collaborative mapmaking over you, Carl.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Thank you.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: I would like ask you if you can share Karel Charvat: The presentation and I would like to start that I'm happy.</p>

<p>What I heard on Karel Charvat: The conclusion, make the sinks.</p>

<p>Simple as I think that this is something what we see as very important to her today.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: To explain how we are trying to do things simple, maybe that we can discuss how to do a little more simple in the future, I would like to ask her if you can start to a some introduction (Stein) Runar Bergheim: I will (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Can you see my screen.</p>

<p>Yes, but I'm first (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Yes.</p>

<p>Okay, so you can see something saying collaborative matchmaking (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Okay, good.</p>

<p>So I'm going to try and make some sort of introduction to this in Europe, of course, it is evening.</p>

<p>I don't know how it is. (Stein) Runar Bergheim: For how our audience distributes among different places, but I expect that during the next half an hour to hour, we're going to discuss a couple of ideas that that that we have had that we will believe it's probably a layer above in complexity of what we've been discussing so far.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Where we've been (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Sort of discussing the base enabling technologies that (Stein) Runar Bergheim: The wiring that is required to efficiently and properly deploy based maps.</p>

<p>We are sort of one step.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: less sophisticated perhaps on higher higher up.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: In the value chain, depending on how you draw up the draw the diagram between the technology and (Stein) Runar Bergheim: End user, but okay.</p>

<p>And we're going to divide the time a little bit between three different speaker says it's right aspersions from from Baltic open solutions in Latvia Carl what who is some sort of competence of the copy of all technology companies in Czech Republic.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And myself ruminate about came.</p>

<p>I'm from a (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Company in Norway.</p>

<p>That didn't think that it would ever operate outside of North America and it shows its name.</p>

<p>So it's called us blonde.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Which makes many people believe that we are some sort of assembly of technologists, which is not a good thing and we (Stein) Runar Bergheim: All belong to some sort of a sibling put that goes by the name of the plan for all Association, which is a spin off from a new year project back in the day.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: So far back in the day that it was back when people still shook hands and said hello to each other.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And.</p>

<p>And finally, it's also the intention that this should be an interactive session and most interactive sessions never turn out to be so, but we have nevertheless the discussion section on this where people should feel free to attack.</p>

<p>And (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And or give voice their support to do whatever we say now, so I'm going to first try to put this into a little bit of context.</p>

<p>And then we're going to demonstrate these two concepts.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And (Stein) Runar Bergheim: So the first thing is that we were sort of encouraged by the first presentation here today when we have this wonderful sentence.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And I believe this is useful for something, but I don't know exactly what because this is sort of the universe we come from.</p>

<p>But when we we have had a relatively small idea.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Of something that we think could be near and valuable.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And we worked on this idea, not because it was scientifically smart or because the world sort of was screaming for it.</p>

<p>And this was a need that would sort of radically change everything universe.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And but once we are presenting this to the OTC which is sort of a behemoth of organizations on maps conversation and contribution to the common good.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: We felt the need to sort of wrap.</p>

<p>What we are saying in a quasi scientific innovation.</p>

<p>So, like so many before us.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: We are going to try and retro actively fit a scientific rationale to our little idea.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And had it not been for the fact that I'm telling you this, this had Mike does lead us lead us to come out in a more favorable light when you when you assess us (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And we are talking about collaboration collaborative map creation and and we have become very good at collaboration, I think, I think it's fair to say over the past 20 years we have become very, very good at this.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: With a process that has involved many of you on various stages and (Stein) Runar Bergheim: I mean, you have made some, some of you who are global players have made decisions and choices in your organization's that from your perspective, have been business decisions, but that propagated to a massive amount of value creation in small communities around Europe that you would never (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Imagine that even existed, like my background here, for example.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And but there are a few things that are still remaining.</p>

<p>I mean, the first barrier that was torn down was map data licensing and (Stein) Runar Bergheim: access to high quality maps used to be used to be one prime barrier of mapping (Stein) Runar Bergheim: But and and we had all these sort of mapping agencies that came out of the military tradition that thought that if people would gain access to data on public roads, it would immediately.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Lead to the full collapse and national security.</p>

<p>But then, of course, Google, our friends started to to to publish global base maps that were (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Better more concurrent and and suddenly there was no sort of good political rationale for saying that we can't give you our data anymore.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And the second catalyst.</p>

<p>I think that was that has been very, very successful was the bed map service, but it doesn't, of course, give you access to the data.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And that limits a little bit the usefulness.</p>

<p>When it comes to many business cases, although it does greatly facilitate the base map delivery aspect.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: But strangely, as was mentioned there before I mean that there are still a couple of file formats and sharing modes that are still common statement 2020 despite being equally common in 1985 well (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Maybe they've made to five but 1995 at least the shape file as has a very long life has been a difficult to kill it.</p>

<p>And I would say that in this era of public sector information ports the.gov waterless to CSV files.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Although technologically not particularly interesting have been the big winner, this is, this is the format that carries the most public sector information and also a surprising amount of the geospatial information.</p>

<p>This is point data comes in this in this guy's (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Become quite good at sharing map applications and these applications come out of two camps as I see them now.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: There are those that lend heavily from the professional jazz software and tried to replicate somehow on the web.</p>

<p>What are just used to be in the 1990s, and there are those that come out of the slipping.</p>

<p>My baby is like the leaflet open layers.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Type of maps that that take it and what we will say a performance approach to creating a good map experience on the on the them.</p>

<p>That is not necessarily designed for people who have been working with us since the 80s.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And however these math applications they give you this challenge that they often give you a tool they give you a blank map which doesn't necessarily look on pleasing.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And and it's very good.</p>

<p>If you know what you want and if you know what you can expect to find there but it often challenges you to make this map yourself.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And this old time map that tells a story is nowhere to be found anymore.</p>

<p>So we are not so adept at cheering maps as we are cheering data and applications.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: We become quite good at creating data and our satellite missions, of course, nowadays provides so much data that we couldn't possibly do anything about it, whether we tried (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And why Lancet, of course, as a foreigner.</p>

<p>I'm Europeans, I need to show Sentinel (Stein) Runar Bergheim: But we have become quite good at this, we become quite good at creating data together to I mean the Open Street Map is a ubiquitous base map.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Map and I think particularly the efforts of the humanitarian open street my team shows that this methodology scales.</p>

<p>I mean, the non centralized ad hoc data capturing to support humanitarian needs on demand, this, this is something that that works very well.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And this is progress.</p>

<p>These are problems that have been solved.</p>

<p>But once we have solved the big problems new ones appear and they are perhaps smaller (Stein) Runar Bergheim: less significant Petty, petty problems one mighty and but user generated content as it is today is very much a dialogue between the user and the application.</p>

<p>It works with (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And this of course presumes that the user creates data is also the user who knows both technology.</p>

<p>Yes, and has the knowledge about the local terrain where he works and and we believe there is some room to enhance this process as we will try to go on to demonstrate (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And then looking at Creation of maps together and we have become good at creating data together.</p>

<p>I don't think we have become good at reading maps together and we don't do it.</p>

<p>And I would say that the state of cartography in the world.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Has shown a unanimously negative development and were early maps used to be you know works of art with borders showing (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Fanciful pictures of the waterfall at the edge of the world and here be dragons and, you know, things that are distinctly pleasing to look at (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Today's cartography is very much more on the nature on on the on the left, they may be more useful.</p>

<p>They may be put to better use, they may be part of common operating pictures in in operation centers but they are not beautiful (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And we think that could be a use case for collaborative mapmaking to (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And the reason for this is that there is five things that haven't changed as much as we could have hoped for.</p>

<p>During the last 40 years and (Stein) Runar Bergheim: One of them is that somewhere in some deep dark recesses of most governments yes departments in 2020 there is still some sort of a large format plotter looming.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And there is still a significant chunk of middle aged grey humans who are who are huddled around poorly ventilated meeting room tables.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: peering over some sort of a printout of a map appointing and stimulating and spilling coffee and cookie crumbs and whatever they do in this process.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: That invariably annotating these maps by markers and they're pointing the fingers a lot to explain what they mean.</p>

<p>And finally, this is hand over to a GIS specialist who then has the very hapless and (Stein) Runar Bergheim: tragic fate of trying to distinguish what is the chocolate chips much and what is a new development area, there should be adjusted in this map.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And dust maps are still edited collaboratively in 2020 so we think that is the room for some improvement there and if 2020 so there's anything (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Except that when it rains, it really, really bored and it is that a lot of physical meetings were are and hopefully shall remain non essential (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And even those of us who are most opposed to progress have been forced to find some sort of way to live with online cooperation in this year.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And so we think that some sort of evolution of of sharing technology could be act at this moment in time.</p>

<p>And we're looking at some sort of a client to client map data creation that allows for a better experience in this way and possibly better quality.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And so I think this is the question that would form yourself in your mind.</p>

<p>So as you hear me drone on about this, there is a (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Distinctive first world flavor to the type of problems that I have listed here.</p>

<p>This is not something that is going to solve world hunger.</p>

<p>Hunger or anything like that but it rings, a little bit of this first presentation of what we think this could be useful.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: We don't know exactly how but we think it could be useful.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: So we leave you to judge whether that is so or not.</p>

<p>And we will move on to introduce the two different concepts.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And then to our (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And interoperable way of describing storing and exchanging a map and, in this context, we're not talking about the map tiles or the rendering of it as such but (Stein) Runar Bergheim: What can you say a portable equivalent of the project files from your gifts and RJ us and whatnot.</p>

<p>Something that would draw heavily on (Stein) Runar Bergheim: The obvious context or the that map context standards that that were created far back, but that doesn't gain a lot of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>These days, although they are in us.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And the second part is a client to client some technology platform to enable client to client interactions for common JS tasks and for these two things we have given some names Mac compositions and map whiteboards (Stein) Runar Bergheim: So the first thing we're going to talk about is the Mac composition and that I'm going to hand over to write this, I will still operate a computer, I think so.</p>

<p>I will be clicking the forward, Keith, but I think writers will speak up.</p>

<p>So you're just telling me when you want the next slide.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Okay, thank you.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Can you hear me. (Stein) Runar Bergheim: I can hear you.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : So yeah, I'm representing Baltic open Solution Center, and I will tell you a little bit more about the compositions Raitis Bērziņš : So, next slide please.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Yes.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Um, well, as I mentioned map composition can be looked upon as a project files and they are kind of a canvas on which we can Raitis Bērziņš : Draw the feature so at some new elements and Raitis Bērziņš : If they have been developed, gradually, together with the the open source components which are listed at the bottom of the slide, namely ain't just layers.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Which is a UI extension of open layers.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And Raitis Bērziņš : It's committed metadata catalog and layman for uploading shape files and converting them into AWS services.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : But actually the origins of the map composition were very humble.</p>

<p>We just needed a way to store the context, context of the current Web Map between reload the page.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : So later on.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Personally had some layers and then we added the possibility for the users to draw some new features on the layers and later on.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : To add more layers to the map.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : But when the pages that are loaded.</p>

<p>Everything was Raitis Bērziņš : Raised and user had to start from scratch.</p>

<p>So we needed to save it somehow.</p>

<p>And from this capability we have had developed it Raitis Bērziņš : We created a race way to share this context.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : So we just had to kill one parameter in the URL of the of this map application and the user of the job was able to share this context between other users.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And this composition could be exported to the metadata catalog main it's got which also can at least have different web services or some Raster images and so on.</p>

<p>And these kind of data layers could be then Raitis Bērziņš : Mixed in various configurations (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Yes.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : The map composition form it Raitis Bērziņš : Is very much based on the old Raitis Bērziņš : Web RTC Web Map context and it's later success successor or WS context.</p>

<p>But what we have done is to Raitis Bērziņš : encode the data into JSON format, so it's easier to parse in the Raitis Bērziņš : Web applications which we have been developing developing engine or JavaScript.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : So it's easier implementation.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Thanks.</p>

<p>Next, please.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And here is an example of composition and on the right side you can see the structure of it.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : It's, it's very much resembles the order is context but it in a in a more simplified for.</p>

<p>So what you have here is some basic, basic attributes describing the context of the whole map or the container like description description and current extent of the map and Raitis Bērziņš : Current selected the base layer because there can be only one of them and the map projection based on upon which the application can decide whether to re project the layer so not Raitis Bērziņš : And also some information about the permissions.</p>

<p>So Raitis Bērziņš : The application then can decide whether to give right permission to the users, we try to mimic the Linux file system using this and then the main or the most important part of the map composition is the list of layers.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Where the order of layers matters.</p>

<p>So the first layer in the error is considered to be the bottom one.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And Raitis Bērziņš : Yeah, so then continues the actual list of layer definitions and it consists of basically two parts.</p>

<p>The parameters which are sent to the server request.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Either that is W.</p>

<p>S. W. FS or different kind of Raitis Bērziņš : Web service and also the parameters which are used by the client side application.</p>

<p>Currently we have implemented the map compositions Raitis Bērziņš : On top of open layers and also some experimentation was done on leaflet.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : So these kind of client side parameters could be Raitis Bērziņš : Single title attribute Raitis Bērziņš : Which tells the application there to request the tile as as one tile for the whole Raitis Bērziņš : Whole Mac window or it will be Raitis Bērziņš : separated into different smaller towns.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And of course the visibility of the layer or transparency or capacity.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And so on.</p>

<p>And for W s layers.</p>

<p>We can request the legend graphics from the web service itself, but for some static layers.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Or static images we have to also provide an area of legends.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And same four dimensions.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : So at the bottom of the slide you can see the the the URL of the schema of the map composition, but that is basically only meant for validating the composition against Raitis Bērziņš : A schema, which could be used on ages layers.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Map library so if if some other Raitis Bērziņš : general quarters on portal solution would Raitis Bērziņš : Use this composition format, then of course it could have different schema because it could support different kinds of players and different parameters for them.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Next slide please.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : The main attribute, which is present for all the layers apart from the URL, of course, is the class or type name of the layer we currently support W s w office.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And Raitis Bērziņš : Vector layers and vector layers.</p>

<p>It's interesting that Raitis Bērziņš : The end result is a vector layer, but the data can come from different sources.</p>

<p>For example, it can be geo JSON file or it can be a W first request or it can be also Raitis Bērziņš : Edit from sparkle endpoint or came out.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And we can.</p>

<p>We also support x, y, z players for Open Street Map being Maps and Google Maps and our GIS rest layers that also support supported the last three types of layers are Raitis Bērziņš : Derived from the layer definitions of opens open open layers.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Next, please.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Victor layers are Raitis Bērziņš : Some divided by protocol property.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : But Raitis Bērziņš : We could support for example sparkle endpoints and what we try to do in this example.</p>

<p>This image was tried to load the data from sparkling find Raitis Bērziņš : It's a five star open linked data.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Format or endpoint from with also where the data.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Comes described where the data is described in day Raitis Bērziņš : It would make the data is contained in the data which comes from the sparkle endpoint itself.</p>

<p>So it's not separated Raitis Bērziņš : But everything in one package and it's easy for the developers to then go deeper to explore the semantics of the data.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And it was also this topic.</p>

<p>Actually, the panel discussion before Raitis Bērziņš : But for vector layers.</p>

<p>The support this single type of Raitis Bērziņš : Data as JSON format.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : And yeah, one of counterintuitive, but quite useful capability is the store geo JSON encoded features directly into the composition as opposed to having a link to some external file or service.</p>

<p>This was intended intended for temporary low volume data such as scratch layers.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Or some layers, where the user can freely draw some features.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Or take notes.</p>

<p>For example, Raitis Bērziņš : But we discovered it quite useful in the whiteboard application which we are developing Raitis Bērziņš : And when this scratch layer is being populated by user at some point the features could be stored or sent to some web series or the layman application which, as I was mentioning before, Raitis Bērziņš : Which converts Raitis Bērziņš : Data either the shape file or do Jason vector data into Wi Fi services and it serves them with Joe Raitis Bērziņš : Joe Raitis Bērziņš : Joe server so Raitis Bērziņš : So at the end.</p>

<p>The features can be merged from the whiteboard server into this map composition and then requested by the user using just one request for example where read this, the application.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Just gives them an idea of the account composition and then Raitis Bērziņš : Your turn gets back that the whole composition description with the metadata the layer definitions.</p>

<p>They can be vectors and vector features or they can be pointers to why.</p>

<p>So why services and also the features which have been drawn using the map Bible Raitis Bērziņš : Yeah, that's all from me.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: You didn't mention one sings that through mid Scott and Lyman this composition can be shared.</p>

<p>Also we skew this as desktop solution and also from queue.</p>

<p>Guess you are able to publish sitemap compositionally Karel Charvat: Into catalog, which could be also shared with that environment.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : Yes, that's some kind of late development.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : recent development, we have been developing your GIS plugin for creating this vector layers and complete my compositions actually can be created in in queue Gs, and then export it to the layman and converted into lists of layers W MS layers very easily and published Raitis Bērziņš : But it's still under development so Raitis Bērziņš : But don't going well.</p>

<p>Raitis Bērziņš : If anybody's interested.</p>

<p>It's available on GitHub.</p>

<p>If you search layman or a just layers for that method.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Okay.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: So then we might move on to say something about this one, which we've been referring to a lot now but which we haven't actually told you what it is. (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And I can I have very unfortunate.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Situation of having developed a cough, which is not a good thing nowadays.</p>

<p>And if if nothing else, you stand at risk to be rolled in tarred and feathered by your neighbors, but I hope you will bear with me. (Stein) Runar Bergheim: I can also see from the camera here that I have turned purple.</p>

<p>But I think that's more a question of lightning than really general health condition.</p>

<p>So hopefully you shouldn't be too very good by the fact that I'm coughing (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And Matt whiteboard or such another Payton determine if it is, it's not painting by us.</p>

<p>It doesn't mean anything except whatever you put into the (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Your own associations.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: However, for the purpose of tonight.</p>

<p>It is or today, I should say, to be slightly more global inclusive and it may be considered to be a peer to peer technology.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And that allows map interactions and modifications don't have to be propagated from one connected with client or other connected all other websites.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Why they're looking at the same map.</p>

<p>So when someone moves the cursor.</p>

<p>I can see it on my screen when someone draws a feature I can see on my screen I can edit the features, they've drawn.</p>

<p>They can mind, we can add layers, the maps and they will show up for all of us, and so on.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: So I had uploaded here a now.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: What, why, why did we want such a thing.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: The first thing is that (Stein) Runar Bergheim: In the early days when we saw (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Sort of the the business cases for GIS with with moving things on screen.</p>

<p>We were very (Stein) Runar Bergheim: enticed by this idea of seeing things moving rather than just a static maps.</p>

<p>And we saw that these please monitoring thing.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: We had GPS transponders on trucks and taxis that allowed you to see where things were very, very pleasing purely from a technical point of view, very pleasing.</p>

<p>We don't own these taxes.</p>

<p>We don't don't these companies.</p>

<p>There was nothing in it for us.</p>

<p>It was pleasing.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And so more relevant to our own lives, of course, we've been using Google Docs a lot for collaborative (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Development of documents.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And that is a very closely related discipline, when it comes to certain things.</p>

<p>And we've been writing documents and we had the pleasure of seeing, you know, working multiple parties on the same things without causing any sort of (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Their (Stein) Runar Bergheim: conflicts among our texts and we would like to see the same thing in Maps.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: We also been working on user generated content, and we have been bothered by the fact that it's always one person or two people sitting physically together in the same room.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Working towards one client application, whereas this possibility of cooperating would require some sort of screen sharing online conferencing tool.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: So we like that and it would still allow only one person at a time to to to work in the map.</p>

<p>And so we thought you'd like to see something like that.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And then of course we have this irrational decided to see things move on the screen.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And I have tried to make a small video of this and I saw that that one wouldn't play so I will try to play it.</p>

<p>I will try to change the different window and play it there.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And this is no bells and whistles.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Nothing particularly exciting, but just for the purpose of illustrating the concept made to full screen map surfaces.</p>

<p>These are rendered in opens in open layers.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: We have made the same client for leaflet because it's not necessarily meant so that this needs to work in one technology or another, it should work on any any platform.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: But I'm going to start playing it now and see if you are able to see anything.</p>

<p>So the first thing is that when I move my cursor in one map.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: The people connected the map can see where I am and each person is assigned that unique color.</p>

<p>Now I've asked this question.</p>

<p>Can you see my screen still (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Get.</p>

<p>Can you see you're playing (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Very good.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Because otherwise this will be Just (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Additional phone.</p>

<p>Okay, so every cursor is assigned a different color.</p>

<p>And when I move in what my connected client my counterpart can see my cursor with it with a specific color so that (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Essentially (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Takes out the (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Business Case of (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Pointing with your fingers when you're standing around this map on this paper map on the table.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: So then the second thing is that I can create data and immediately when I create this data.</p>

<p>They show up at all connected clients.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And I can connect concrete or simple features is just publication and using all.</p>

<p>I mean, this just depends on the implementation that the transfer of data is using (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Geo JSON might be that we shouldn't go to some more compressed thing because (Stein) Runar Bergheim: The volume here could easily drive traffic but you're able to create geometries of any, any kind, and we are able to see that they show up and but I have created the geometry.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: A person can go to that geometry and modify it in the other window.</p>

<p>So we have read write access to all features that we have created collaboratively.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And and the same mechanism.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Applies for property.</p>

<p>Property property editing So attribute editing and also for adding another layer.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: To the I don't know what's happening there.</p>

<p>Also for adding another layer to the map.</p>

<p>So if I, if we are sitting in this sort of a Mac user context and a government department and (Stein) Runar Bergheim: We are we are assessing some some map.</p>

<p>We can say that okay we need, we need some supporting information I can add to the web servers from my side or or a shape file or whatever and then immediately be visible to all other users as contextual information that can be turned on and off.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And similar things and then we can we can see yesterday to go.</p>

<p>So we are able to both author the maps themselves and the photography as well as the data content.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Of the maps and and that satisfies a number of business cases that we we (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Many of our customers are suffering from and that is a bigger problem for them in the era of covert 19 than it was before.</p>

<p>When they at least had the opportunity to meet in this very small meeting rooms of theirs.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And their technical architecture of this (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Is based on (Stein) Runar Bergheim: HTML5 client.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Could be could be of course desktop clients curious, or just whatever I mean any sort of connected client or it could be rendered on on Nathanael for that in the future and (Stein) Runar Bergheim: We did these could be implemented using any any library we have so far just implemented this for an open layers and and leaflet and something some branches, I should say some branches of openers (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And in addition to publish.</p>

<p>And then, initially we thought of just having this as a standalone editing technology that that only allowed you to edit vector geometries and in our, in our random Jason layer.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: But then we had in peril.</p>

<p>This map compositions format which which has great overlaps with the old WS context and so on, which is might be questionable, but we had that one in our stack.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Because we just described, we needed it for some some projects.</p>

<p>So we thought, okay, maybe, maybe it would be nice to be able to edit both the vector layers themselves and to edit the map.</p>

<p>So we chose to use the map composition as the carrier (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And in terms of lightness of load, because here.</p>

<p>There's a lot of messages going back and forth between the client and the server, and then being distributed again.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: We chose chicken do Jason because it's fairly light.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: fairly light way of encoding beta (Stein) Runar Bergheim: So the server part of this.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Has (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Documented API. It's written in no Jess and socket I O yeah and it would typically be hosted behind some reverse proxy when it isn't a production environment.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And and immediately when my cursor moves.</p>

<p>Of course, there goes a message to the whiteboard server that user so on so connected to map so on so (Stein) Runar Bergheim: That's moved this message is immediately propagated to every connected client and the state is synchronized on each client independently.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: But of course, if a client falls out and reconnects that it's necessary also to synchronize this on the server.</p>

<p>So we have (Stein) Runar Bergheim: State management in MongoDB, but it's behind this.</p>

<p>So, whenever we make any sort of map update is immediately flush to Mongo DB. So there is a completely updated version of the geo JSON and all of the map composition sitting on the server at any time.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: So if you if you connect to disconnect and come back.</p>

<p>Nothing is lost, it remains (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And there is of course a few issues here also, because if you want to have.</p>

<p>I mean, this is a far less demanding technology that is what is it, it's not basic infrastructure like what what the only presentations here described this is sort of an edge feature and application.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And but still it has some performance issues because (Stein) Runar Bergheim: If you would like to have smooth curves cursor movement and very very (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Responsive interfaces, you would need to transfer data on personal possessions in roughly every 20 milliseconds look like this.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And that leads, of course, to a lot of data being sent back and forth.</p>

<p>So even Joe Jason might be might be too bulky for this.</p>

<p>So you might use something like a protocol for something like this to to speed up or minimize the data that are being that are being transferred (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And (Stein) Runar Bergheim: This is a very simple thing.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: But surprisingly, of course, an API that should be able to handle this on the server side needs to include quite a lot of stuff and (Stein) Runar Bergheim: We have to have User Management.</p>

<p>I shouldn't mess up your mark.</p>

<p>You shouldn't mess of mine.</p>

<p>And so even though we allow people to collaborate.</p>

<p>We need to have the same permission model as exists in in (Stein) Runar Bergheim: In Google Docs, where people can have read access or editor access or comment access to suggest access and so on.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: We need to document management needs to be able to upload and download these things and control who can do it and we need methods to handle (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Streaming have all these interactions.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: From the server to the client and the server doesn't really care very much about the rendering of this (Stein) Runar Bergheim: It cares just about propagating messages.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: But it needs to have some basic level so features and properties are represented as Dr. Jason features are stored in layers layers of stored and Mark compositions and map composition or rendered as maps on (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Their users have cursor's that move on the map.</p>

<p>Whenever move or hover interaction hover event is detected is propagated all connected client.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And users can add layers to the map and shift the layer water which will also cause the same to happen on all connected clients, but only for the specific map that they're connected to, of course.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: So that is the essence of this little feature.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Now is this something to talk about to do GC is this really a standardized interaction protocol or is it an application feature I can't say with great certainty, if not white boards have a potential beyond being a feature.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: But it is something that (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Is fairly interesting to the day to day business of many of our, our clients and people who are collaborating across government departments.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Find this intriguing and and have have started to sort of express interest in in buying it and (Stein) Runar Bergheim: More politically they buy it integrated into their solutions.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And the people who are operating field data capturing applications where typically one professional is trying to have a dialogue with a non professional find this interesting because it allows one person to have a dialogue with another one.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: While they can see the same thing on the map and they can point one person can create data.</p>

<p>One person can indicate his local knowledge, while working in the same (Stein) Runar Bergheim: So perhaps they do the API that we are making at least would be opened and published as an open specification.</p>

<p>It's not an opposite of skin, but it will be published as as an open thing and whoever might find it interesting could contribute to it evolve it was slow (Stein) Runar Bergheim: And but then again standardization should not be applied where standardization is not do so i'm i'm not sure if this is something that we should tell us as a standard thing.</p>

<p>But I think it's something that is (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Relatively interesting but the discussion section that we have some time for now 12 minutes, I suppose, specifically is devoted to the value proposition of this and and i think the discussion should be centered on the value (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Creation, rather than revenue creation.</p>

<p>I mean, if this can add value to someone or something.</p>

<p>It's a good (Stein) Runar Bergheim: If it can read revenue that's perhaps interesting but it's not interesting to discuss in a group.</p>

<p>And so let's stick to the high road and the nobler goals.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: What can we do in terms of creating value.</p>

<p>And with that, I shall remain silent.</p>

<p>I think and hand the road back to current who will moderate this chris wallace style.</p>

<p>There was no (Stein) Runar Bergheim: tokens of obvious violence in the first section.</p>

<p>So I imagine this would go well.</p>

<p>And this last one minutes also Yours.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Are you still there.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: I was Karel Charvat: One thing is to discuss about potential Karel Charvat: Technology can be used as Karel Charvat: What Karel Charvat: Is my job and I am the most involved is Karel Charvat: Farming.</p>

<p>And what we see that Karel Charvat: There are discuss usage of as observation data and other data and the Karel Charvat: Farmer is never using directly Karel Charvat: Data and never processing this data.</p>

<p>So there is usually some interesting chain or the people who are preparing for data and preparing recommendation.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: On other side to the most of farmers hate to work with black box and to be not able to understand why they have to do something so Karel Charvat: There is really necessary that the for example advisor, who's preparing some recommendation for farmer has the possibility to communicate with the farmer exchange with him.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: The result as him for the comments and in some cases farmer is telling.</p>

<p>Okay, I know that this part of the field has different Karel Charvat: Behavior and please I would like asked you to change the parameters for, for example, applying of nitrogen in this field and this could be the way how Karel Charvat: That could be communicate, of course, I think that the typical sink.</p>

<p>So, which could be used is any type of planning because usually Karel Charvat: Planning is based on the fact that planner is preparing some plan, then it is discuss with public Sarawak if there is, for example, spatial plan, then it is discussed.</p>

<p>So is people usually the way sides that the brands are in Karel Charvat: Better case visible on the internet invite worst case you have to go to the office and to draw on the maps, what is necessary.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: For education.</p>

<p>I think that it is also very good Karel Charvat: Instrument.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: We see the potential in some type of the crisis situation where the Karel Charvat: Person who is managing the team can online, put some information for for the user.</p>

<p>So there is the number of potential RS where we are sinking and we are now trying to apply this technology.</p>

<p>And generally, we will be interested about your ideas.</p>

<p>Next.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Are you willing to take questions.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Yeah.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, we can, yes, you can have some questions, we are ready to answer.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Great.</p>

<p>Well, I have a question from Brian a burger, the hips in and get her.</p>

<p>He says you have essentially done everything besides contextualizing your data.</p>

<p>Have you looked into producing five star data.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: You provide a link so Peter Rushforth: Five Star link data.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Know, I think that Karel Charvat: Right.</p>

<p>This mentions that Karel Charvat: We are able to visualize Far Side data.</p>

<p>Yes, he mentioned that we are able to read the idea of data.</p>

<p>Other things is that our metadata catalog.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: It is based, the initial.</p>

<p>It is based on is all this 1950s and 1939 standard, but the this Mitch guy is also supporting meta data in Karel Charvat: God cut IP saw this are five stars meta data.</p>

<p>So we are working, we are moving in this direction and also know we have some data which are five star like part point of interest.</p>

<p>And this is the reason why we are trying to do this.</p>

<p>So we are moving to the five star.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Okay, thanks.</p>

<p>So Bryan Haberberger: Thank you, Brian.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Bryan Haberberger: I'm glad I'm glad that catch the question didn't catch you off guard.</p>

<p>I was actually expecting something different.</p>

<p>I'm glad you guys have thought about it.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: And we have in this plan fall Association, which we we have introduced a terrible amount of concepts without this explaining what they are here, but this plan for all Association.</p>

<p>We have among others.</p>

<p>A few big linked open data sets.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Which are where are some of the content is the content varies between three and five star according to the standard and we are trying to use.</p>

<p>Among other things, this technology in (Stein) Runar Bergheim: A coordinated user generated content effort to complete increase the quality of the data.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: To to achieve five star data.</p>

<p>So it's, it is close to home in terms of our, our day to day problems.</p>

<p>Bryan Haberberger: Yes, that's, that's good to hear.</p>

<p>How have you looked at the geo JSON LD specification.</p>

<p>Because essentially, if you get Bryan Haberberger: You get, you get five star data for free with that context.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Yes, yes, the (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Only problem with with every.</p>

<p>Yes, yes.</p>

<p>I mean, it's I agree fully.</p>

<p>The only problem with standards is that (Stein) Runar Bergheim: When we work on developing standards we always we always become very happy when the standard is finished.</p>

<p>But once the standard is finished, we have to populate it so so the population part is (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Not going as fast as the thunder.</p>

<p>But I think the standard is there definitely did (Stein) Runar Bergheim: It's definitely helpful.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: To to allow us not to make some sort of massive duplication of effort.</p>

<p>Bryan Haberberger: Yes, definitely.</p>

<p>And all it would do as it exists is provide that modular support for the geo JSON and you guys are doing something much more and supporting other formats, which obviously geo JSON LD would do.</p>

<p>Bryan Haberberger: Nothing for you for this thing, your, your context is much more complicated than just that simple web context for the geo JSON format.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: It is.</p>

<p>It's conceivable but then again, I think what we are doing is probably a great deal less complicated than it sounds like, and it's (Stein) Runar Bergheim: part by the fact that we have been given an hour to talk about it and we are very intimidated by the presence of all this greatness.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: In the audience.</p>

<p>So we feel the need to wrap it in in scientific sort of rationale.</p>

<p>But what we, what we're doing is fairly simple.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: shamefully so in comparison with not much of what you're doing, but it is sort of a connectivity between what happens on the infrastructure level and the business value that we still think is an interesting part of the value chain, but it might.</p>

<p>It might not be (Stein) Runar Bergheim: It might not be on the same precision level as as as what happens in the great strategic decisions of the world.</p>

<p>Bryan Haberberger: Thank you.</p>

<p>It was great to see.</p>

<p>And that was that's that's the gist of what I wanted to say.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Well, thank you very much for your discussion and presentation.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Maybe can you go, I'm in a slide deck.</p>

<p>I think I (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Think that should be within my cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: This one you may Karel Charvat: Not know this this one.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Because this Karel Charvat: This development is now included as a part of so called code inspire hackathon.</p>

<p>It is the UN, which is running two months and the first what right is presented is tall in this first challenge and the second is Karel Charvat: In this child.</p>

<p>So if anybody will be interested to discuss these things with us.</p>

<p>We will be very happy to invited you and to continue in the discussion because this development will continue.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: One man's and as we mentioned, we are not only trying to finalize the solution, but we are also looking for different business cases.</p>

<p>So if you'd be interested.</p>

<p>We can share with you more details.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: You want to share the links are Karel Charvat: In the presentation.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: presentation will be available this are the links, I can, I can send or I can share a link later because this is a presentation will be available it is Karel Charvat: Possible to Bryan Haberberger: Go if it helps.</p>

<p>I just went to the agenda, and I was able to download the PowerPoint.</p>

<p>So I have this links now.</p>

<p>Bryan Haberberger: Okay, they already have it up.</p>

<p>Bryan Haberberger: I think I'm pretty sure Peter Rushforth: That's what this is great.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Okay, I think that if there is no more question.</p>

<p>I think that our time is almost over ruin our us that we will be shorter, but seems that we use all our time.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Well, I don't think there's anyone who will cry for this.</p>

<p>I think (Stein) Runar Bergheim: People will fall asleep tonight with a Ringing Ringing of our voices in their ears and wondering why.</p>

<p>So I think we should have preemptively apologize to those and thank everyone for attending.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Thank you for press presenting a very interesting application and looks like it's going to be a winner.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: So I guess with that will we can, we'll sign off.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Unless there's some more messages, there's links in the chat that if you want to have a look at those.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: And so we can end the recording and we will post the recordings, as soon as possible and talks as you submit them.</p>

<p>So thank you all for participating today and tonight.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: And have a good day.</p>

<p>We'll see you tomorrow.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: Peter, thank you to give us opportunity to make to present our backs.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Peter Rushforth: Lovely.</p>

<p>Bryan Haberberger: Thank you.</p>

<p>Yes, thank you, all presenters.</p>

<p>That was a great day.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>And the best advice to you.</p>

<p>(Stein) Runar Bergheim: Awesome.</p>

<p>Return to pine for the fjords (Stein) Runar Bergheim: Bye.</p>

<p>Karel Charvat: See you.</p>

<p>Bye.</p>

<p>Bye bye.</p>
