1
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.030
Peter Rushforth: Sounds like it's going.

2
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.910
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay! So, welcome everyone to week

3
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.280
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Two of the W3C and OGC's Joint Workshop on Maps for the Web.

4
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.120
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Bit of logistics in case we have some new visitors.

5
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.230
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: We're talking live on zoom chat. There will also be all the videos posted to YouTube later.

6
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:58.440
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Live Chat as we go along, including questions for panelists, preferred if it goes into the Gitter chat I posted the link in the zoom chat. Beyond this, the Zoom chat, we try and encourage only for Zoom technical issues.

7
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.050
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Because it's not an archived forum and we'd like to keep the conversation going for people who

8
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:21.930
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Can't be here right now because it might be a horrible time where they are. Thank you for those of you who are here right now, even if it might be a horrible time. We're glad to have people to talk to

9
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:47.970
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And of course for longer form discussion, lasting after the call, we have the Discourse discussion as well. I would like to remind you that we were operating under the W3C's code of ethical and professional conduct. If you have any concerns about

10
00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:06.870
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Anything that is happening in the sessions in the chat. You can contact any of the program committee or the W3C ombuds office, I would like to thank Natural Resources Canada who have been sponsoring a lot of the work on this workshop

11
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.790
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And

12
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.160
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Including the captioning. If you're here live there is somewhere in your bottom toolbar of the zoom

13
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.900
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Option to show the CC closed captioning of the discussion.

14
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.320
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I think that's all our logistics. I'd like to get started.

15
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:53.400
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Our first theme of the day or a theme for the first hour is how maps can improve accessibility for people navigating in the real world. We're going to start with two talks and then have a panel.

16
00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:19.050
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Our first talk is by Sebastian Felix Zappe on physical accessibility data and maps Sebastian is Tech Lead at Sozialhelden in Germany, a nonprofit focusing on disability rights, they're involved in many different projects on this theme, including

17
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.440
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Wheelmap, an online map of accessible places.

18
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:48.930
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And accessibility JSON. A 11 why JSON data standard for describing accessibility and the W3C community group on Linked Data for accessibility. So that's about all the information I have, Sebastian, I welcome you to take the mic and share your screen.

19
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.790
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Yes, I hope you see everything and you can hear me. Well, thanks for this introduction. Um, yeah, I'm Sebastian Felix from [inaudible]

20
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.220
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Welcome to this and let me stop, start, quickly. So what we focus on today is mostly the things

21
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:21.300
Sebastian Felix Zappe: If you have a physical place you often have the problem "Can I get in", if you, for example, have a stroller for your child or if you have a wheelchair or you're blind or if you need spaces to be quiet for you. And there are many other examples where

22
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.150
Sebastian Felix Zappe: You might find a physical place not accessible. And that's what we care for

23
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.260
Sebastian Felix Zappe: We built this thing called Wheelmap.org that's an app you can download for your smartphone or using the browser.

24
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:45.360
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And it just shows you access of places all around for people with wheelchairs this case they're just marked in red, green, or blue. The other screen

25
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:59.220
Sebastian Felix Zappe: To show if they are accessible. And if you zoom in. You can also see that they are shown in different ways. So everything that's green is a circle. Everything that's red is a square, which means it's accessible for people who are colorblind.

26
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.470
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So it looks a bit like this.

27
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:23.550
Sebastian Felix Zappe: If a place is fully accessible, It's, as I said, green, and circle. If it's partially accessible, it's, it's a polygon in orange. If it's not accessible, it's a red square on this map. And I would also like to recommend if you if you do anything that has to do with accessibility,

28
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.260
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Use something that is as simple as this. And we are we're available in 32 languages right now.

29
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.260
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So it's

30
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.510
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Already quite international

31
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:49.560
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And wheelmap.org is based on OpenStreetMap. And so this means all the information you put into WheelMap is uploaded to OpenStreetMap and the other way around. If you

32
00:05:50.310 --> 00:06:07.290
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Mark a place accessible on OpenStreetMap for wheelchair users, then it's going to show up on Wheelmap as well. And we started around 10 years ago, with this project. In the meantime, we've got around 1 million

33
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:16.500
Sebastian Felix Zappe: OpenStreetMap based places on wheelmap.org that are marked as fully partially or not wheelchair accessible, completely by users.

34
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:30.360
Sebastian Felix Zappe: The thing is, when you build an application like this, you, you build a kind of second world for people with disabilities and

35
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:47.700
Sebastian Felix Zappe: The question is always, does this mean like, is this issue solved now for people with wheelchair? So if you've got a wheelmap.org, does this mean that you can now like use the world. Does this mean equal participation and we think it does not

36
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:58.650
Sebastian Felix Zappe: We think that things like wheelmap and other apps for people with disabilities are just a intermediate step towards disability mainstreaming.

37
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:09.780
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Disability mainstreaming means that all accessibility information should be available everywhere. So we think that this information does not belong into Wheelmap, it belongs into Google Maps, for example,

38
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:16.290
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Apple Maps and Yelp and all the all the apps that are related to this. So basically, every app.

39
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.830
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Every app use case should be available for as many people as possible.

40
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.600
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And we think that maps for the web. And now we know we finally get to why we are here.

41
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:39.240
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Is a perfect case for this because everybody who's the computer, which is not everybody on the world. But most people

42
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:51.270
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Use a browser for browsing the web. And if we can make applications accessible in browsers, in all browsers.

43
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:59.040
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Then this is a big step towards disability mainstreaming because this means that everybody can participate in everything that's available on the web.

44
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:11.730
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So our question was, could we make maps for the web specs to make accessibility information is available everywhere. So can we kind of solve a part of this issue.

45
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:25.920
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Let me first make a short course, um, where can you get physical accessibility data. So if you build a map application, for example, and you want to build in accessibility, you have to of course know

46
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.470
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Where to get this information if its accessibility of about physical places.

47
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.590
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So first, of course, you can go to OpenStreetMap.

48
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:41.370
Sebastian Felix Zappe: There could be an example where there was a hotel on OpenStreetMap and there is a way that connects this hotel to the next street.

49
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:54.240
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Which is connected to the next subway station and all this information can be augmented with accessibility information on OpenStreetMap so you can, for example, say the hotel has an entrance. It's at a specific

50
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.660
Sebastian Felix Zappe: specific location on a map. And it might have multiple entrances.

51
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:12.240
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And one of them is wheelchair accessible and one is not, for example, the hotel could also have tags on the street that tell you that it's for example a quiet space or

52
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.660
Sebastian Felix Zappe: That there are tactile pavements that allow you to access this entrance

53
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:28.320
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So you can get data about accessibility from OpenStreetMap already. So this is already existing you can of course also get it from wheelmap.org as I just said.

54
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:36.510
Sebastian Felix Zappe: On wheelmap.org you might also have information about a specific hotels entrance, and if it has a ramp, for example, if this ramp is fixed.

55
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.850
Sebastian Felix Zappe: If this is a fixed installation, or if it's a mobile ramp that has to be put there by somebody

56
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:51.810
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And you can also find information about rooms. So for example, if there was a bathroom or a specific kind of toilet and what kind of amenities this toilet has.

57
00:09:53.790 --> 00:10:00.210
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Or you could, of course, go to a hotel booking platform that's kind of obvious and find photos about how the place looks and

58
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:10.200
Sebastian Felix Zappe: If you, if you can, if you can look at photos, if you have this ability, then this might help you to, to, for example,

59
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:17.880
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Prepare yourself to enter the end of the place through this one entrance and to see beforehand how it looks.

60
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:32.160
Sebastian Felix Zappe: For information like this, Sozialhelden has build accessibility.cloud, an open online platform for sharing this kind of data too, because OpenStreetMap is already quite nice for this whole thing, but

61
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.410
Sebastian Felix Zappe: We think it should be

62
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.290
Sebastian Felix Zappe: It should contain more accessible information. So when accessibility cloud, we

63
00:10:41.460 --> 00:11:02.430
Sebastian Felix Zappe: We have an API that you can use it looks a bit like how I showed you on screen, so you can have a an application talking that you can register on this web platform and here in this case I'm using a CURL request to query places on the map and you get back GeoJSON in this case.

64
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:18.960
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Accessibility cloud is connected to a lot of partners in the meantime we are supported by a lot of organizations that shared data on accessibility, in many cases for free and as open data so you can use it in your apps as well.

65
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:42.060
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Three apps that use this API that are shown here, ImmoScout24, a big real estate platform in Germany, I Wheel Share, which has a chat bot to query accessible places all around you in France, and Wheelmap.org itself. So it's like, if you as a partner.

66
00:11:43.200 --> 00:12:00.780
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Or as an accessibility data source are connected to accessibility.cloud and register there and put your data online, it's pretty easy to let it show up in applications like the shown ones here and also of course in Maps for the web application soon, I hope.

67
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.990
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So here are the 79 organizations that accessibility.cloud right now is connected to

68
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:19.020
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And they contribute around 1.3 million places to accessibility.cloud and Wheelmap and 3.8K real time elevators as well, to Wheelmap.

69
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:37.320
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So this is also containing life data, which is also really relevant because if you have for example a wheelchair or if you're blind, you're often relying on elevators and escalators, and they are often out of operation. So if you notice in advance. This is really, really helpful.

70
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:46.500
Sebastian Felix Zappe: The problem with all this is that there are many accessibility data sets in the world and

71
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:58.860
Sebastian Felix Zappe: They are not very standardized, they all use very different vocabularies so we need to kind of harmonize them to make these available on accessibility cloud and in many cases this means

72
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:10.440
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Somebody sends us a CSV table or something, and all these CSV tables look very, very different. So we created a standard called a11yJSON and

73
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.290
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And you can look it up on A11yJSON.org

74
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:33.120
Sebastian Felix Zappe: It's a standard that is meant to harmonize all these different vocabularies that allows you to query information, for example, about a toilet in the way that it always looks the same, no matter which kind of data source you look at, so I will give you a code example now.

75
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.900
Sebastian Felix Zappe: It looks like this. So the

76
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:51.540
Sebastian Felix Zappe: The code shown here is a GeoJSON feature on a map showing specific cinema and it's got a geometry and properties, so you can see that it's a cinema and how the cinema is called.

77
00:13:52.110 --> 00:14:01.800
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And it includes a accessibility property as well. And this accessibility property is formatted in A11yJSON. And what you see here in this

78
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:12.120
Sebastian Felix Zappe: code snippet, in this A11yJSON code snippet, is that the place has two entrances, That one is the main entrances- That one is the main entrance and the one other one is the site gate.

79
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:22.020
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And that the site gate has a fixed ramp and that the main entrance is level. So you can access it without a step and that its name is 30th Street.

80
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:29.700
Sebastian Felix Zappe: It also shows that the cinema is accessible with a wheelchair and that there is an animal policy, that means that

81
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.820
Sebastian Felix Zappe: The cinema allows you to to enter

82
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:49.350
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Allows you to enter with a guide dog, which is not which is not a law or something in every country, so it might make sense to to mark these places. So you can know which place. For example, you can enter with the guide dog and which one you can't so

83
00:14:50.490 --> 00:15:01.080
Sebastian Felix Zappe: There is this animal policy thing in A11yJSOn as well, here are some interfaces, interface specifications that A11yJSON and specifies. So there is accessibility, there is this

84
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:24.180
Sebastian Felix Zappe: previously described animal policy, you can describe elevators, escalators, folding handles for toilets, ground quality, media mirrors, parking, pathways, payment, personal profile, so it means you can you can have data sets that tell you that specific groups.

85
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:29.700
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Can access a service or a place and place enforce

86
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:40.920
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So, for example, like the shown cinema, and it describes the ramps, restrooms, rooms, showers. For example, training for staff so

87
00:15:41.610 --> 00:16:03.180
Sebastian Felix Zappe: If staff has sort of certificate and is trained in specific things, then you can also mark this, it describes stairs, tables, toilets, washbasins, wheelchair parking, and wheelchair places in cinemas right now. So, these are the main interfaces that you can find in A11yJSON and they're already used

88
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:14.760
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And what this all is meant for is, we have a lot of these platforms on the web. So all of these platforms could publish

89
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:16.980
Sebastian Felix Zappe: A11yJSON data.

90
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.210
Sebastian Felix Zappe: The thing is that, A11yJSON itself.

91
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:33.030
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Isn't isn't what we want. It's also just an intermediate step towards something bigger. And what we want is we want all platforms that exists on the web to semantically describe

92
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:47.550
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Their content on the web with with stuff like schema.org, for example. So we looked at schema.org and we also try to extend schema.org with missing vocabulary for accessibility.

93
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.870
Sebastian Felix Zappe: On the screen you see some of these platforms.

94
00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.800
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And how they describe accessibility and

95
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:02.520
Sebastian Felix Zappe: We don't want this information to be just there on the web pages. But of course, a user

96
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:11.370
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Who wants to look up all these things, for example, somebody who wants to book a room on a hotel platform wants not to look at, at

97
00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:22.530
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Like three websites, for example, or like like 10 websites to find all this information, but they want to have everything in one place, obviously. So if they go to a platform that say booking.com

98
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:38.550
Sebastian Felix Zappe: They, they want to have all the information right there when they, when they look at a room, at a specific room that is offered on the web page, they, they want to know about the accessibility as well. And that's of course, true for everybody. And we use booking platform so.

99
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:43.080
Sebastian Felix Zappe: All the information from these platforms has to somehow end up there.

100
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:52.890
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And this is what Linked Data is for this is what schema.org is for so schema.org allows you already to to describe and, for example,

101
00:17:54.030 --> 00:18:03.780
Sebastian Felix Zappe: How places are connected. What, what kind of place you have in front of you. So if it's, if it's for example cinema or hotel and it allows you to to link

102
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:10.650
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Data across several platforms and easily connected with each other.

103
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:13.500
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So,

104
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:33.510
Sebastian Felix Zappe: How could you describe physical accessibility in these standards. The thing is, that this is not standardized yet, this is something that has yet to come. So it's not there yet. And we thought about some ways to to maybe get it standardized in maps for the web as well. So here are

105
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:39.270
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Next two ideas how we could describe all these things in maps for the web.

106
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.810
Sebastian Felix Zappe: First example.

107
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:55.140
Sebastian Felix Zappe: There's an MapML proposal and we think that it might be a very, very good idea to as early as possible extend it with semantics data.

108
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.160
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So currently it's something that is very, very visual.

109
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:19.440
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So, it contains geometries and it contains information about how to render these geometries correctly visually. But if you would describe the features that are shown on the map, or in a visualization, in a geo visualization. If you would describe them with semantic meta data.

110
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.210
Sebastian Felix Zappe: The browsers

111
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:39.570
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Or the user agents, for that matter, could find out what the shown data actually means which is currently not possible yet. So this needs this kind of proposal, I would have shown here is a feature in MapML. So a probably, probably read it as a marker on a map.

112
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:54.900
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Again, a hotel, and what we thought was, we could just extend this with things like micro formats or with with RDFa for example. So this is I'm looking like the idea of a standard

113
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.360
Sebastian Felix Zappe: In websites.

114
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:17.760
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And it describes that this shown feature on the map is a hotel, and it has a specific amenity feature and for for this semantic description, it uses schema.org, so it uses features that are already available. It's not a dog. So this could, with this very simple proposal already be done.

115
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:32.520
Sebastian Felix Zappe: It would mean that the browser will understand that the shown point on the map is a hotel, and it would be able to, for example, read to a user that this hotel has a wheelchair accessible sauna, which is specified in this code.

116
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:43.740
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Another example of which we thought was, we could easily just A11yJSON as a sub property in CityJSON. So CityJSON is a format that describes

117
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:55.890
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Whole cities, their buildings, their building parts and for example entrances on, in buildings and buildings inside as well. So it can be used for indoor mapping, and

118
00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:02.580
Sebastian Felix Zappe: The building parts could just be augmented with this accessibility as described before it could just be

119
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:23.250
Sebastian Felix Zappe: A11yJSON built into CityJSON and this proposal does not exist, it. This is just an idea and we'd be happy to talk about this in the later discussions, if this is a good idea. Maybe you have better ideas and better feedback, how to how to get this done. And if we put this into CityJSON

120
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:30.960
Sebastian Felix Zappe: This might be a great way to easily integrate accessibility for physical data into browsers.

121
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.810
Sebastian Felix Zappe: If we do this, this opens up a lot of new possibilities.

122
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:46.170
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Because, of course, user agents can be extended with browser extensions, it means that everybody was a specific need.

123
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:54.510
Sebastian Felix Zappe: could theoretically download a browser extension that would change the display of an existing map

124
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.250
Sebastian Felix Zappe: To their needs.

125
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:05.310
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And this is a really, really, really big thing because this does not exist yet. And this, this would be very, very helpful. So just imagine

126
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:15.660
Sebastian Felix Zappe: It could it could even make real accessibility better in the world. So there could be built in things like if a place is more accessible.

127
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:23.550
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Than different one, that more accessible place could be ranked differently in the labeling. So for example, let's say,

128
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.410
Sebastian Felix Zappe: You are blind and you need

129
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.680
Sebastian Felix Zappe: You need a restaurant, for example.

130
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.510
Sebastian Felix Zappe: To be accessible for your maybe have a Braille menu, just as an example.

131
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.890
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And this Braille menu would be specified in A11yJSON

132
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:51.780
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Then, the places that do have this, could be shown as labels in higher zoom levels, in lower zoom levels and the other ones could just be

133
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.460
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Not read out by the screen reader and

134
00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.530
Sebastian Felix Zappe: All the most

135
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:10.050
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Relevant places for you would just be like, right, first with with the higher the higher rank. So like for example, Google ranks web pages.

136
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:19.350
Sebastian Felix Zappe: By their accessibility, a map could rank places by their accessibility and this would be an incentive in the real world, just for marketing reasons and for

137
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:27.990
Sebastian Felix Zappe: For visibility reasons for, for example, restaurant owners, for hotel owners to build in real accessibility, just because it makes them more visible on the web.

138
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:34.050
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And this would be a really, really big thing because it would change the real world. Just because we would build an algorithm for it.

139
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:42.450
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And this would be something that would be really nice and some other examples include colorizing places as shown on, we're not

140
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:55.830
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Using a traffic light system. So if a browser knows that a specific place has a ramp. For example, it could mark this place green, but by default, without the author of the map having to do anything would just be built in into a browser or a  plugin.

141
00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:07.140
Sebastian Felix Zappe: It could add indoor map context, links to places. So for example, you could right click by click on a place and by right clicking on your desktop on this place,

142
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.940
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Context menu could show up and offer you an indoor mapping different application, because you would have to semantic info about the place

143
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:21.510
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Or you could augment that with accessibility features. So, for example, wheelchair users could always see elevators on this map.

144
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:28.950
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Like, no matter, no matter which map is and by whom it is made elevators could just be displayed because there is a browser plugin for it.

145
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:39.540
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And nobody nobody would have to care as an author, but could be displaying accessible toilets. You could be displaying inaccessible or accessible sidewalks. For example, if they've got a

146
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:47.460
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Spot on the sidewalk or difficult sidewalk surface, which is relevant for many people, it could just be displayed on this map.

147
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:52.920
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And it could be displaying ramps and stairs or many people

148
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:59.100
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Need specific environment noise levels and have difficulties, for example.

149
00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:07.290
Sebastian Felix Zappe: With hearing and listening to a conversation if the environment noise level is high, this is also stuff that could be displayed on the map.

150
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:13.140
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And last, it could allow voice assistant to understand what map features actually mean

151
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.510
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Something that's really important here is

152
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.200
Sebastian Felix Zappe: That

153
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:21.300
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Yes.

154
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.480
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: How close are you to wrapping up? We're going over time.

155
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.570
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Almost, almost like two minutes, I think, is it okay for you.

156
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:44.550
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Oh, okay. So what's really important is, of course, the user doesn't want to disclose their health an application. So all these a11y features, if they are built into process, they need an extra layer of protection. So, for example, disability isn't, is not disclosed to every website visit

157
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:53.010
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So like location, the browser should allow you to allow or deny to share this information with a website.

158
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:08.220
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And browsers and plugins and should not be reveal it if you don't want to share it, of course. And the other thing is that you always get this issue with user intent versus a map authors intent. So

159
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.450
Sebastian Felix Zappe: You could have something like aria labels so like HTML aria labels. You could also add this to maps.

160
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:27.510
Sebastian Felix Zappe: To give to give as an author hints to a screen reader or to use user agent, how to how to use them for accessibility. It could say something like the visual style of this feature should be

161
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:37.650
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Rendered like this if this is possible. I can say a map is a geo data visualization or it's made for discovering places which are like, totally different use cases. So the browser could

162
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:57.390
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Could use this information to to make the map more accessible as well and how you can help, for making all this happen, is participate in schema.org GitHub issue #254 which is the accessibility issue in schema.org and help us get this into schema.org

163
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:08.070
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Of course, participate in the W3C Linked Data for accessibility community group. So be really helpful. So if you if you can join us and join the discussion.

164
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:19.530
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Do so please, and give A11yJSON a star on Github to make it more visible because many people don't know that this exists yet if they would know probably they would already be using it.

165
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:27.000
Sebastian Felix Zappe: And add data sets, if you know them on accessibility.cloud and other platforms to make them available to the world.

166
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:32.280
Sebastian Felix Zappe: So that's my ask. Thank you for listening and watching

167
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.540
Sebastian Felix Zappe: Thanks, there's my contact information.

168
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:57.120
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Thank you Sebastian. Well, I already see there is lots of questions going on in the chat. People are excited about GeoJSON and Linked Data around here. So I hope you can connect up with people. I'm going to continue on to our

169
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:04.800
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: next talk is Claudia Loitsch and Julian Striegl

170
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.860
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Somebody else's sharing the video.

171
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.130
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay.

172
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.430
Peter Rushforth: Yes, I'm going to share for Claudia. Yeah, no problem.

173
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.790
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay, so, Claudia Loitsch and Julian Striegl.

174
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:33.480
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Recorded their talk in advance. They are researchers at Dresden University of Technology, focusing on mobility related requirements of people with visual impairments.

175
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:41.490
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: In particular, with a focus on navigation and orientation in indoor spaces.

176
00:28:44.280 --> 00:29:00.930
Julian Striegl: Hello and welcome everybody to the presentation "Accessible Indoor Maps: Information Need and Automated Solutions to Address Gaps in Maps for People with Disabilities". My name is Julian Striegl. And I'm presenting this topic, together with Dr. Claudia Loitsch. We both work at the Dresden University of Technology.

177
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:12.540
In our project AccessibleMaps. We have an international and interdisciplinary team of the Dresden University of Technology and the Karisruhe Institute of Technology.

178
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:29.730
And we are working together on innovative and new solutions to improve mobility within buildings, our project aims to develop software that automatically generates indoor maps enriched with accessibility features and you can find more on our project on our website accessiblemaps.de

179
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:50.880
Our main motivation is the social relevance of the topic in particular because independent traveling and mobility is challenging for people with visual and mobility impairments. People with disabilities face several barriers when navigating to or orientating and unfamiliar buildings.

180
00:29:51.960 --> 00:30:05.100
Overcoming permanent or temporary barriers is very challenging for people with disabilities. And for instance, you can see on the slide that ground level objects are sometimes not detectable for blind people using a cane.

181
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:15.120
So why do we focus on Indoor Maps? Well, compared to outdoor and public transport the indoor area has so far received the least attention.

182
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:23.700
At least in terms of data maps and user research and we believe that, in addition to navigation applications. Indoor Maps

183
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:37.140
Will help with the orientation in unknown buildings for people with disabilities. If you want to create accessible Indoor Maps for people with disabilities, you first need to understand the needs and abilities of those people.

184
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:49.410
David Fazio: People with disabilities need granular information about the layout orientation features as well as temporal relations, for example, obstacles such as construction sites to find their way independently.

185
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:59.640
David Fazio: Mobility impaired people primarily require structural information as they experienced barriers such as narrow doors or passages, lack or nonfunctioning

186
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.370
David Fazio: elevators and escalators, lack of handrails and even walking surfaces and heavy doors.

187
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:17.010
David Fazio: Furthermore, mobility impaired people rely on information such as slope of path, flow covering, manual or automatic opening of doors or accessibility of restrooms.

188
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.640
David Fazio: Visually impaired people also require structural information such as handrails and wayfinding information.

189
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:37.500
David Fazio: And they can experience barriers and complex and confusing buildings or buildings with bad lighting conditions, moreover, information about the availability and location of Braille signs and tactile paving is helpful.

190
00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:46.740
In addition, it is important to understand that people with disabilities have different requirements for planning of a trip and its implementation.

191
00:31:47.640 --> 00:32:02.190
The diverse information need is represented in table one. You can see, for example, that information about the type of doors or the location of a floor plan and more important for people with visual impairments if they are within a building.

192
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:15.870
A problem, however, is that no common approach to collect and make information about physical accessibility of buildings available for different user groups and for all parts of the travel chain exists currently

193
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:25.860
Therefore, collecting those information is time consuming, or even not possible. It requires users to know where they can request their required information.

194
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:38.400
Accessible maps for the indoors can be a solution, but they must represent sufficient data about physical accessibility and they must be accessible for diverse users and contexts.

195
00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:49.170
Before being able to present accessible maps to people with disabilities, it is, of course, necessary to have a good databases of indoor maps.

196
00:32:51.270 --> 00:33:02.700
Currently, there are no widely accepted open standards for the expression of accessibility information in indoor maps and there's a lack of methods to assess if Indoor Maps comply with the requirements of people with disabilities.

197
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:18.960
In terms of orientation and indoor navigation. In the scope of the accessible maps project, we therefore analyzed the quantity and quality of indoor maps exemplary for OpenStreetMap, as it is one of the most successful volunteer geographic information projects.

198
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:25.710
To analyze the quantity and quality of existing indoor maps in OSM we use the overpass API.

199
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:41.670
And the used request for the API were formed based on tags specific for the mapping of indoor areas with the simple indoor tagging schema of OSM, which is the currently chosen standard schema for indoor mapping in the OSM community.

200
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:52.050
The bare minimum of needed tags for an working indoor map in OSM are the mid level and max level tag on the building polygon or the building relation

201
00:33:52.530 --> 00:34:02.070
And the level tag on points of interest inside the building. Furthermore, the four basic indoor elements room, area, wall and corridor can be used to model the floor plan of the building.

202
00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:13.800
As a first analysis of the state of indoor maps. We looked at four major European cities, Berlin, Rome, Vienna and Paris and two main statements can be derived from the collected data.

203
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:25.860
Firstly, for all European cities, there's a strong inbalance between the number of objects marked as buildings and the number of objects mark to be in an indoor environment with the 'indoor yes' key value pair.

204
00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:32.760
This indicates that the number of maps for indoor environments is sparse, regardless of the used indoor tagging schema.

205
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:46.800
Secondly, even though, SIT(Simple Indoor Tagging) is the tagging schema currently chosen for indoor mapping by the OSM community only a small percentage of objects have SIT associated tags.

206
00:34:48.600 --> 00:35:00.510
And on the left hand side. Here you can see an example of the discrepancy between the number of buildings that have an SIT related tag and the number of buildings that are completely mapped using SIT

207
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:14.850
The quality of maps indoor geospecial information in regards to accessibility is of utter importance when analyzing how existing Indoor Maps in OSM suit the requirements of people with disabilities.

208
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:24.330
Therefore map buildings with further analyzed in regards to their consistency and used indoor tags their completeness of provided in geospatial information

209
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:42.300
And mapped accessibility specific features such as elevators, ramps, provided Braille signs and tactile pavings. On average only 6.75 buildings per city met the minimal SIT requirements, and on average, only one building per city met the requirements of SIT completeness.

210
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:59.550
And the complete data set, only four buildings included mapped accessibility features for mobility impaired people such as ramps and elevators and none of the analyzed cities have buildings with mapped accessibility features for visually impaired people such as Braille or tactile paving.

211
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:16.650
David Fazio: An example of the fluctuation in in map quality in OSM, can be seen on the left hand side. Both depicted buildings fulfill the minimal SIT requirements, however, only the upper map has sufficient information to be suitable for indoor navigation purposes for people with disabilities.

212
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.560
Let us now briefly talk about accessible representations of indoor maps.

213
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:30.210
There are many and diverse approaches to make virtual maps accessible but mainly for people with visual impairments.

214
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.870
On the slide you can see three different techniques.

215
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:41.220
Tactile maps are most frequently used and effective for learning spatial structures and for orientation and mobility training.

216
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:47.190
On the slide you can see a indoor map that is produced on swell paper.

217
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:57.210
Another technique, are virtual acoustic maps which convert map items and two different sounds and directly inform the user about the environment.

218
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:05.640
Microsoft has, for instance, develop the app Soundscape that enables people with visual impairments to hear landmarks around them in 3D.

219
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:16.080
Another technique are audio tactile maps which is again another technique that focus on multimodal interaction techniques to augment maps with alternative information.

220
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:31.440
There are again very different approaches on the slide, you can see a refresh trouble and touch sensitive Braille display with which a blind person can explore a tactile map. Additional alternative Information can be received via a tap gesture.

221
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:45.720
There are many more techniques that address the needs of people with visual impairments. The problem is that currently there are no standards on how maps and geographical data should be made accessible for different contexts and diverse user needs.

222
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:58.380
So we know less about how people with impairments in the upper body can interact with maps or how maps can be simplified for people with mild or severe a cognitive impairments.

223
00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:09.840
Several key challenges can be derived from the analysis of the state of the art of accessible indoor maps for people with impairments and from the analysis of the requirements of the different targeted user groups.

224
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:17.310
Firstly, there's currently a low coverage of indoor maps and indoor schemas are inconsistently and incorrectly applied.

225
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:27.390
Specifically information on accessibility for indoor areas is not available for most public buildings and there's a lack of standardization for the accessibility domain.

226
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:39.300
Secondly, the data collection process for indoor accessibility information is quite tedious. The required level of detail of indoor information is too high to achieve with traditional mapping methods.

227
00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:47.490
Commercial digital platforms focus mostly on the mapping of points of interest, instead of mapping of detailed geospatial information.

228
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:55.350
Currently there's a lack of knowledge concerning the information needs of people with disabilities in the mapping community.

229
00:38:56.190 --> 00:39:05.970
While accessibility projects do exist in the volunteer geographic information community for the outdoors similar projects are needed for indoor environments.

230
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:17.220
And lastly, people with disabilities are a diverse user group with varying sensory, physical, and cognitive abilities that can be two different accessibility challenges with digital maps.

231
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:27.750
To tackle those challenges we propose the following possible solutions for the collection and representation of accessibility information for indoor areas.

232
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:34.230
To tackle the challenge of the insufficient prevalence of accessible indoor geospatial information.

233
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:45.060
semi automatic processes for the creation of said information are needed, therefore, in a first step, a vocabulary for the mapping of indoor accessibility features needs to be defined

234
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:52.620
Furthermore existing maps in the varying schemas for indoor mapping should be transformed to one basis of data.

235
00:39:53.700 --> 00:40:03.360
already existing Indoor Maps need to be analyzed in regards to their quality of accessibility information and therefore corresponding tools are needed.

236
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:14.400
Finally, semi automatic and crowdsourcing approaches should be used for the collection of accessibility information and the mapping of accessibility features in indoor areas.

237
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:27.870
And based on the collected information accessible and individualized representations of indoor maps should be generated and you can see different examples of possible outputs on the right hand side.

238
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:44.190
Finally, we would like to say that the development of Indoor Maps is still in the early stages. It is expected that the market will grow significantly in the next years due to an increased demand from location based service providers.

239
00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:54.300
Who will take a more economically motivated approach such as considering merely points of interests, instead of mapping accessibility related aspects.

240
00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:00.900
Therefore, we believe that it is currently a very good time to consider the aforementioned challenges properly.

241
00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:11.250
And to take accessibility into account at an early stage and the development of standards for web based maps and not as an afterthought, as it is usually applied.

242
00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:21.150
Our contributions to this area are dedicated user research for mobility in unknown buildings in the accessible maps project and beyond.

243
00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:36.480
Software to significantly improve the coverage of indoor maps and solutions for barrier free map representations for different contexts of use. So we would love to get in touch with you for futher collaborations and contributions to this topic.

244
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:43.080
And with that, I would like to thank you all for your attention, and I wish you a pleasant day.

245
00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:58.590
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: That was Julian Striegl on the recording, his colleague Claudia Loitsch  is with us here today. And as always, Keep

246
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:12.780
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: posting your questions in the Gitter or Discourse and we'll try and continue the discussion beyond here. I'd now like to ask our members of the

247
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:30.150
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Panel to join us. I think that we are still missing someone, I haven't had any response from Lisa Seeman, so I hope she is well, and just having internet difficulties we will do our best without her.

248
00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:40.410
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So our next topic of the day is continuing along this theme of accessibility.

249
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:45.900
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Maps helping with accessibility in the real world.

250
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:51.780
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The panelists are members of the

251
00:42:53.430 --> 00:43:08.490
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: cognitive and learning disabilities accessibility Task Force, otherwise known as Coga, so I'm going to let each panelist quickly introduce themselves.

252
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.910
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Let's go across on my screen, John Kirkwood?

253
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:17.940
John Kirkwood: Yes. Hello. Can you hear me.

254
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.190
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: We can, you're a little quiet.

255'
00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:23.310
John Kirkwood: Okay. Is that any better.

256
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:39.780
John Kirkwood: Okay, distance from mic. Okay. Hi, my name is John Kirkwood I'm on the cognitive accessibility task force of the W3C. I'm very interested in this topic as well because I was the

257
00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:47.190
John Kirkwood: Advisory Committee representative for the New York City Department of Education.

258
00:43:48.300 --> 00:44:04.440
John Kirkwood: For the W3C and I was involved with making all their sites for their various schools, 1700 schools, accessible to people with disabilities in particular their websites, but I also sat on

259
00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:17.130
John Kirkwood: Their building accessible, accessibility board and we needed to make every one of their schools accessible to people with disabilities, which includes of course wayfinding

260
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:30.210
John Kirkwood: Through every school and incorporates all the different types of disabilities that people have. So if one has a disability due to triggering from lighting

261
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:40.920
John Kirkwood: They would need to be able to have a map for them in order to make it through the school without getting triggered by these lights so

262
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:52.350
John Kirkwood: The former speaker talking about standardization of indoor mapping and then bringing that to the larger scale,

263
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:59.460
John Kirkwood: would optimize the processes needed for especially a large school system like the city of New York

264
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:13.170
John Kirkwood: To make all its sites accessible to people with disabilities, independent of their accessibility needs. Andd I sit on the cognitive accessibility Task Force and W3C with other panelists here

265
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:26.820
John Kirkwood: talking and trying to figure out how to standardize around web accessibility for people that might have memory issues, queuing issues, sequencing issues, age related issues, that would that would affect

266
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.450
John Kirkwood: Their ability to navigate

267
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.430
John Kirkwood: Due to

268
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:48.000
John Kirkwood: Occipital lobe or parietal lobe issues with their brain function. So this is all very fun, interesting to me, I'm lucky to join the other panel members on the cognitive accessibility task force here to discuss this.

269
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:54.720
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Thank you John. Okay. Continuing on to John Rochford. Can you give us a brief intro?

270
00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:11.100
John Rochford: Yes, absolutely. So I've been interested in way sfinding for quite some time and the background material that Amelia posted to the conference agenda page, it has two

271
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:20.160
John Rochford: Documents. One is an issue paper about indoor wayfinding for people with cognitive disabilities and I'm the primary author of that.

272
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:38.580
John Rochford: And it also has my collection of wayfinding technologies that I've been keeping it updated for years, both indoor and outdoor so I i I'm going to be adding to that collection all these wonderful resources that I've learned about in the past couple hours and I totally agree with John

273
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.050
John Rochford: That

274
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:47.250
John Rochford: Most of the what I loved about what I heard was that

275
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:57.840
John Rochford: You know, the focus on everybody, including people with cognitive disabilities. Many people with cognitive disabilities also have physical disabilities. So it's important to us too

276
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:09.570
John Rochford: But we have some unique needs. So an example of that is that is people with dyslexia, for instance, have difficulty with left and right.

277
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:18.270
John Rochford: They confuse them often and so directions that say take a left down the stairs, take a right, that's going to confuse them.

278
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:36.060
John Rochford: And another one is along their routes, if they get interrupted. They have difficulty reestablishing the route. So if their supervisor says, hey, I want to talk to you about X and then they have to go back to their, their work route. It's difficult.

279
00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:41.070
John Rochford: So that's really all I have to say, and I'm,

280
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.440
John Rochford: That's as brief as I can be.

281
00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:48.900
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay, David, you want to give us a quick introduction?

282
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:58.290
David Fazio: Sure. So just like everyone else. I'm an invited expert to the cognitive assessment Task Force. I'm also a survivor of traumatic brain injury. When I was 13 I had a

283
00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:09.030
David Fazio: hemorrhagic stroke that size of a softball my right parietal lobe that me blind, and left half of each eye cognitively impaired and completely paralyzed and left half of my body.

284
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:20.430
David Fazio: I founded a company by the name of Helix Opportunity funded by our nation's vocational rehabilitation system and we focus on user experience and inclusive design consulting

285
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:27.090
David Fazio: With an expertise in the areas of neuropsychological and cognitive design. So, of course, this is really, really

286
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:40.800
David Fazio: Interesting to me and an important aspect of what we do is user research on trying to figure out different ways to implement cognitive accessibility and design strategies so that people don't have these kinds of issues that John and John have both

287
00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:44.910
David Fazio: Discussed. And, leave it at that. That's brief enough.

288
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:51.900
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay, so you're all kind of touched on this in different ways, but

289
00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:59.430
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Not everyone here is an accessibility expert. I think most people understand

290
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:18.270
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: When we talk about wheelchair accessibility and ramps and why that is relevant to maps. Can we give a quick overview of what you mean by cognitive is accessibility and how it is related to maps and web maps in particular.

291
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:28.800
David Fazio: Absolutely. Um, I can start off just talking about three things I posted in the chat earlier attention, memory and perception. These are super important because

292
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:33.540
David Fazio: When you're going about your daily life been going through an environment, you get used to the environment that you're in.

293
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.850
David Fazio: And once you get used to the environment that you're in, you start perceiving things going around you going on around you.

294
00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:46.110
David Fazio: You're still, you're still aware of them. Your body's still sensing these things but you stop actually perceiving them and noticing that there there.

295
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:50.310
David Fazio: What we're talking about, there's two different kinds of memory: recall and recognition.

296
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:57.900
David Fazio: When we talk about maps, we're talking about recognition, recognizing where you've been, where you're going, how to get there and how to get back

297
00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:05.010
David Fazio: If you're on your path and you basically tuned up the world around you because you're used to the environment that you're in. Everything seems kind of similar.

298
00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:10.920
David Fazio: And nothing catches your attention to let you know that it's a key marker that you need to pay attention to so you can find your way back

299
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:17.550
David Fazio: You're going to get lost. And the same thing goes for when you're going somewhere. If you don't know where to turn because something doesn't grab your attention.

300
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:25.710
David Fazio: And in order to grab your attention, these, these cues is what they're called. They can be audio cues or visual cues. They have to be what's called salient

301
00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:35.010
David Fazio: S-A-L-I-E-N-T. Salience is very, it's very organic, and it's very unique to each person, which is why user research is so important.

302
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:42.060
David Fazio: Salience can be the size of something. It can be the shape of something. It can be the color. It can be the way that it moves.

303
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:48.840
David Fazio: But if it doesn't have some type of salient prominent properties. It won't catch your attention. You will tune it out and you will miss it.

304
00:50:49.470 --> 00:51:01.620
David Fazio: Also, if you're stressed in this environment while you're going through it, you're going to miss these cues also. Because what happens is stress blocks your brain from producing the cells necessary to create new memories. So as you're

305
00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:08.460
David Fazio: Reading a map in an environment, your short term memory is kicking off, connecting one.to another to another to another.

306
00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:16.680
David Fazio: Light. If you're stressed out and your brains on creating those memories for the short term or the cells for the short term memories, you're going to, you're never going to make it.

307
00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:28.950
David Fazio: You're never going to have that connection from point A to point B to point C. So that's why the map experience must be seamless and must not be stressful and amongst the, cogent and coherence for people

308
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:51.750
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay, um. Do either of the Johns want to jump in and talk about how that experience in how the brain works in real life, relates to the experience of the map itself, and what can make a map

309
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:56.100
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: widget or visual map or whatever.

310
00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.110
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Better for those

311
00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.960
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Types of comprehension.

312
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:13.830
John Kirkwood: I'll attempt a little of that I think David made some very, very good points there and sort of sketching out the needs there. And one thing that

313
00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:31.950
John Kirkwood: I too had a brain injury, and it affected my occipital lobe and parietal lobe, the parietal lobe is the area of your brain that that actually does the mapping and it's the part of the brain that lays down the maps for you. And I found that

314
00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:53.610
John Kirkwood: With my visual deficits and this particular issue with my parietal lobe. I was not able to essentially as David said, remember sort of left or left or right, you know, into and that that I couldn't couldn't do that from memory, but I use cues.

315
00:52:54.630 --> 00:53:05.220
John Kirkwood: Just like I would use, walking through a hospital when I was recovering, and I my cue would be in particular a painting on the wall.

316
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:16.260
John Kirkwood: And I knew. Hey, I might not know which direction I need to go. I might not be able to lay down a map in my head, but I knew that once I got to that I needed to walk towards that painting.

317
00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:20.160
John Kirkwood: And once I got to that painting. I would look for the next cue.

318
00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:28.380
John Kirkwood: And I could go from that cue of memories, like, oh, I have, once I get to that made that painting, I looked and I saw the elevators, like, ah,

319
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:44.760
John Kirkwood: That's where now. Now I've made it. However, I wasn't able to put that map in my mind I but I was able to follow that story or have the breadcrumbs and some people will work by stories with their mapping and some people might do it through internal

320
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:54.900
John Kirkwood: mapping out in their, in their minds eye, where they are in placement on a map. So the storytelling, the salience of that that and the

321
00:53:55.290 --> 00:54:07.200
John Kirkwood: Ability to remember things and cue oneself. But by having that sort of impact of the story, there's a way that that can assist people with mapping sometimes or navigating

322
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:19.050
John Rochford: So this is John Rochford, John Kirkwood there's something about you that the left right vision, could you explain that, please. I think it's really

323
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:31.200
John Kirkwood: Yeah, to be very specific and this is similar to David what as well. I think it's Homonymous Hemianopsia, which is half vision in both eyes.

324
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:41.550
John Kirkwood: So I can see to the right, I look at someone's face, as I'm looking at your faces on video right now. And if I look at John Rochford's face.

325
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:54.210
John Kirkwood: And I look at his left eye, I cannot see his right eye. So thinking about that and how to navigate through the room. We walked through one room.

326
00:54:54.690 --> 00:55:11.640
John Kirkwood: And then you see a door and you walk through the other. And now you have to return to the table you were sitting at and you've seen on that path. You've seen planter and a window, but on the return path you're seeing a classroom with tables and and uh

327
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.290
John Kirkwood: You know,

328
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:20.220
John Kirkwood: A water fountain and an exit sign which is nothing that you've seen going the other direction.

329
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:42.360
John Kirkwood: So the idea of cueing and mapping and trying to really learn how to spatially navigate and to put that into memory so that one can functionally exist that, as John was asking there, was specific to the the visual center and the mapping area of the brain.

330
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:50.520
David Fazio: Can I add something to that? So, you know, this is, this is something that is true for all people, but for people with cognitive disabilities.

331
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.960
David Fazio: We can have lapses in time where we blink and we don't realize how long

332
00:55:55.260 --> 00:56:02.310
David Fazio: How much time has passed, so you know when you when you're coming back to an environment and you don't recognize where you are and you thought you were where you needed to be

333
00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:07.560
David Fazio: It can really bring on a lot of anxiety, a lot of stress and really freak you out.

334
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:13.710
David Fazio: And this again goes to the how the stress can create memories and stuff like that. And that just completely throws everything off.

335
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:21.300
David Fazio: And I remember times when I was 13 years I was, I was 14 years old. I was 13 when my brain hemorrhage, but we had just moved to a new neighborhood.

336
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:31.890
David Fazio: And the houses were just being built up and all this kind of stuff. And I was leaving the house walking around the neighborhood. I'm new, I'm a new kid trying to find new friends to make stuff like that. I would get lost for hours.

337
00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:39.540
David Fazio: I couldn't recognize the streets, the houses or whatever to find my way back, and I would freak out. I would almost like being tears.

338
00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:44.970
David Fazio: Not knowing what to do. And I mean, I can't tell people where, where I live, because I'm new to the neighborhood. I don't know.

339
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:52.530
David Fazio: Whether I can remember my street name you know so and that's that's for people with cognitive disabilities but even for people without cognitive disabilities.

340
00:56:52.800 --> 00:57:04.560
David Fazio: The same situation happens if you're on your way to a job interview or you're on your way out to a date or somewhere important and you get and you can't figure out where you are because you can't recognize the cues and stuff like that. It can freak you out.

341
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:17.280
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay, um, that actually leads into my next question. So I think you've effectively convince people that for someone who's had a traumatic brain injury.

342
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:31.140
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Navigation can be incredibly difficult but for people who are building a Web Map, there's probably some question about how big an audience that is and

343
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.150
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Is it really effective for them to think about it in

344
00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:44.400
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Every map they make or is that something that people with accessibility needs will need special software and

345
00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.140
David Fazio: Yeah.

346
00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:46.830
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: What is

347
00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:50.400
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The broader interest here or how

348
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.570
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Can that connection be made.

349
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:55.710
John Kirkwood: So how

350
00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.290
John Kirkwood: Could I start with that one really quick?

351
00:57:58.290 --> 00:57:58.890
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Go ahead.

352
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:05.850
John Kirkwood: John. Yeah. One thing the way to really think about globalizing that is everyone

353
00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:24.510
John Kirkwood: At some point in their life, their parietal lobe will start decreasing in its functionality and in when you're aging as one of the things that that does go is how to spatially navigate

354
00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:33.930
John Kirkwood: And we will all have this at one point and we will need help and technology as we're aging will help us more and more

355
00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:47.460
John Kirkwood: And as as technology meets us as we all age. These things will be things that we will be completely dependent on as we're dependent on our Google Maps when we're driving

356
00:58:47.730 --> 00:59:00.300
John Kirkwood: We're going to be dependent on the indoor maps to make it through hospitals or rehab facilities in the or aging facilities or independent living for anyone. So that's one one point.

357
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:11.010
David Fazio: I have a number for you too. 300 million people will have dementia by 2050. 300 million around the world.

358
00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:16.230
David Fazio: That's a lot of people with cognitive disabilities. So if you're looking just for a number about what the

359
00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:27.690
David Fazio: That that's just one subset of disability. Then you've got people with developmental disabilities, people with brain injuries from the military, from just regular life all those different kinds of things. And like John said, plus it's just

360
00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:36.330
David Fazio: Everybody in general as we degrade as we age, so that it's important. And think about this, when you're driving around the city looking for a place

361
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:44.460
David Fazio: You know, a building or an event or a venue. It's really dangerous to have to be looking at a map and focus and focus all of your cognitive resources.

362
00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:52.320
David Fazio: On trying to identify where you're going, as opposed to watching the road. Right. So there's a huge market opportunity and implications for this.

363
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:56.280
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Um,

364
00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:14.550
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay. So, assuming you convinced everyone that making maps better for cognitive accessibility is a necessity. What does that actually look like at the software level, at the geospatial data level.

365
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.850
John Kirkwood: Well, I'll start with that one. Delivering the right information at the right time.

366
01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:34.440
John Kirkwood: So if, if you, you might be someone that remember seven steps and directions. And you can say, Okay, I just need to look at this once, and I'm, I'm, I'm fine.

367
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:48.420
John Kirkwood: But you might prefer to have your directions repeated to you when you are 200 meters from your next turn, or maybe you want it half a mile from your next turn.

368
01:00:49.140 --> 01:01:02.310
John Kirkwood: The customization of how information is delivered to you, dependent on what your functional memory needs are, is would make it more accessible and more usable for everyone.

369
01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:11.730
John Kirkwood: And these can be learning, there can be a feedback loop in your own mapping programs from your Google Maps to where you're driving when you ask for the directions more often.

370
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:25.230
John Kirkwood: Or from your maps and indoor wayfinding within a hospital so that your, your information is delivered to you in the way that you need it in accordance with your memory functioning that makes it a better user experience for everyone.

371
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.880
John Kirkwood: Okay.

372
01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.840
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Any other comments on how map software can be better.

373
01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:39.300
David Fazio: I'll also say one thing, is that a lot of user research needs to be done, including people with cognitive disabilities and without

374
01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:42.180
David Fazio: People with cognitive disabilities are one of the least

375
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:48.060
David Fazio: We're one of the neglected demographics when it comes to not just accessibility, but also in user research

376
01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.160
David Fazio: Because we're perceived as not really being active in the in the economy, you know, so

377
01:01:53.490 --> 01:02:01.980
David Fazio: A lot of user research needs to be done to actually flesh out what can help and benefit people with cognitive dissonance in terms of, you know, mapping and stuff like that and

378
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:09.360
David Fazio: Another number for you is $19 trillion in household earnings is how much people in the baby boomer generation are worth.

379
01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:16.500
David Fazio: You know, if they're going to be out there spending money and stuff like this. We need to know how to help them best navigate their environment to get to the places to spend their money.

380
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:24.750
David Fazio: And that's just in, you know, G20 economies. So, you know, user research is really important. We don't have enough data.

381
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:34.050
John Rochford: That is what John and David are saying

382
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:52.830
John Rochford: All the efforts that we've heard about today, everybody must involve people with disabilities and the development of these technologies, because if you do not, they will fail. And they will fail for everyone.

383
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:57.630
John Rochford: And it's not just people with disabilities. It's all kinds of populations of people

384
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:06.060
John Rochford: Who have low literacy, people can't read directions, for example, and are enormous populations of people

385
01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:17.100
John Rochford: Like non native language speakers. So if you've got your, your directions in English or you are relying upon alerts to represent like

386
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:18.720
John Rochford: whether the

387
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:23.130
John Rochford: Place is successful or not, and green and red, you know, green is good

388
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:32.220
John Rochford: Accessibility, red is bad. That means different things in different cultures. So my pitch to everybody is

389
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:38.430
John Rochford: That all this technology we're talking about, talking about has to be

390
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:40.620
John Rochford: Effort if it's going to be successful.

391
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:54.750
David Fazio: Providing salient cues is super important. But again, salience means different things to different people, which is why the user research is so important. So, I mean, I can't stress that enough. We need, we needed to a lot of research.

392
01:03:56.550 --> 01:04:02.520
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay, so user testing customization and,

393
01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:08.730
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: focus on how people actually recognize things in the real world.

394
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:28.020
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Very quickly, we're gonna wrap this up. But I have a question from the audience. What is the room for web standards in achieving these goals. Can we standardize it or is it just a matter of best software development practice.

395
01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:31.020
David Fazio: We're working on it. That's what we have the task force.

396
01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:46.410
David Fazio: We just published a content, guide for content usable, a guide for making content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. It's published as a W3C note, I want to say, but you can find it online.

397
01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:59.040
David Fazio: That should be pretty helpful to a lot of people. It's a good starting point. It's design best practices and information about what people cognitive disabilities experience. So yeah, we're working on standardizing

398
01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:06.360
John Rochford: It's right on the web accessibility information page on the W3C

399
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:17.370
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: We will find that link and add it to the chat. Any final comments as we wrap up the panel.

400
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:22.590
John Rochford: It's been my honor and privilege.

401
01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:26.670
John Rochford: I really appreciate the opoprtunity, thanks.

402
01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:31.860
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Well, thank you for joining us. It is good to have these perspectives on

403
01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:39.390
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: How software and web maps can actually impact people's lives.

404
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:42.750
John Rochford: I'm thanking you for your expert moderation.

405
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.550
John Rochford: Thanks very much.

406
01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:45.750
John Kirkwood: But would also like

407
01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:54.570
John Kirkwood: We on on the cognitive accessibility task force. This is something that we very much welcome input from

408
01:05:55.650 --> 01:06:05.940
John Kirkwood: From professionals or people interested in the field, because it is a very large area. And as you take the layers of the onion off

409
01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:19.260
John Kirkwood: I think we all realize that the scale is very large and we need we need help and expertise around that. The more that we can get more involvement we can get from people, we welcome it with open arms.

410
01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:31.080
David Fazio: We wish we had more concrete and like you know technical specs to give you that what you could implement but that's, you know, where, where it's lacking. We need more collaboration.

411
01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:32.850
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Mm hmm.

412
01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:37.650
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Yeah yeah needs more research is often the conclusion.

413
01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:50.010
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Well, thank you, we're going to wrap up the panel and I'm gonna immediately change gears to our second theme of the night, because we are running a little behind schedule.

414
01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:54.540
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Now.

415
01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:23.190
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Our remaining talks are on the general theme of can we improve map data web servers and map data formats to make them better for web use. And I'm going to start with a pre recorded presentation by Nicolas Rafael Palomino.

416
01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:39.720
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So, Nicolas is a researcher studying on wireless telecommunications and unified telecommunications, with a focus on geo location and geospatial data.

417
01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:52.950
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And his presentation is on advanced analytics software project for geospatial data. Can somebody please let me know that you're seeing the video player.

418
01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.410
Peter Rushforth: Yes, we are.

419
01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:56.550
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay.

420
01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:10.260
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And the Zoom overlay is right on top of the play button. There we go.

421
01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:22.980
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: Hi, as mentioned in this page. My name is Nicolas Rafael Palomino. In this presentation will be talking about advanced analytics for geospatial data.

422
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:33.780
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: We'll be discussing why and how harnessing big data with complex mechanisms is essential to be implemented by the tech industry to keep their place as we move forward to the edge.

423
01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:45.690
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: We will start the discussion with the interactive maps widgets and its infrastructure and I will explain why advanced analytics are important to be harnessed and implemented in the digital cloud connected infrastructure.

424
01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:56.010
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: So here we can see some basic maps widget we could interact with. The picture of the map, you're looking at is showing downtown Montreal as a basic potential map format.

425
01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:05.970
Peter Rushforth: What we are trying to do here is to integrate new technologies, including Advanced Computing, big data analytics and artificial intelligence to set up the advanced analytics.

426
01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:17.310
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: That will autonomously or semi autonomously examine data or content using sophisticated techniques and tools, typically beyond those of traditional business intelligence, to discover deeper insights

427
01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.320
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: make predictions or generating real time data to bring life to the Internet of Things.

428
01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:30.810
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: In the next page, We have bringing life to the Internet of Things, which will be one, if not the most important constituent of the whole IT system.

429
01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:42.210
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: In the most small rectangle, you can see the experience of the user that is shaped by the advanced analytics, and that experience will be the customer or individual interacting with the whole platform.

430
01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:51.990
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: This part is autonomous, and best suited to serve the individual customer or person using the services. This will be done through the system of advanced analytics.

431
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:56.610
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: This system will be leveraged by artificial intelligence, machine learning

432
01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:08.640
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: And advanced analytics to give a more in context, predictive and pervasive geospatial data available to the persons using the navigating tool and all that will be running on the cloud connected IoT devices.

433
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:13.110
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: Next up, we have the values that are unlocked by using this new infrastructure.

434
01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.940
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: The first point here is the new business models, implementing hybrid IT cloud

435
01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:24.210
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: Or any cloud services to a business under connection systems will redesign the centralized IT infrastructure

436
01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:37.140
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: Because distributing network hubs in locations at the edge offers direct access to customers, partners and other ecosystem participants leading to new business models and business intelligence, and that will bring new business models.

437
01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:47.640
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: Second, we have the seamless customer experience, that will be fueled by artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics that will be running on cloud services.

438
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:59.010
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: This service will enhance many aspects of life, such as the safety and security of whatever transaction is going on, as well as the quality of services that are provided either physical or digital.

439
01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:12.000
Nicolas Rafael Palomino: This optimized responsive value chains will connect in real time and in context, physical and digital materials with different types of computing services and processes in place of eco systems.

440
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.840
Here in the next page. We have the basic uses provided by the interactive maps.

441
01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:26.280
The first point. Here's an interesting concept I experienced myself. Basically, I went to a restaurant during the COVID-19

442
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:39.720
pandemic and I noticed the restaurant was not providing menus, but instead they told us to scan a little QR code with our phone cameras and that code redirected us to the restaurant menu with a hyperlink.

443
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.890
I think that's a perfect example a service that could be provided

444
01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:58.890
And optimized by using different layers of ecosystems involving intelligent machine, the machine and even to machine communications and different layers of artificial intelligence, machine learning processes and analytics through the cloud interconnectivity infrastructure.

445
01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:06.030
Such technological mechanisms will provide the user a much more adjustable in client centered services.

446
01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:18.990
The second point is retail stores or commercial uses which does not really differs from that restoration system I experienced, but yet are two different system in a way because of the different variables.

447
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:34.860
The way we want users to generate data is by making them access and interact with any type of data, an IT system that is useful to them and that can be provided by the factory, retail store, or any data that is accessible by location or non location.

448
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:44.520
Smart factories are defined as flexible and fully connected factories that are able to make use of constant streams of data from operations and production systems.

449
01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:55.020
The amount of possible interactions is endless and creates unprecedented industrial scenarios where items can talk to each other with tools, machines remote computers or workers.

450
01:12:55.590 --> 01:13:08.640
human centered design is an approach to systems design and development that aims to make interactive systems more usable and useful by focusing on their use by operators and their requirements within the collaborative industrial environment.

451
01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:18.210
This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves even user satisfaction, accessibility, and sustainability and counteracts possible adverse effects of

452
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:20.760
health, safety and performance.

453
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:36.990
These systems together with the design principle of the industry 4.0 will connect manufacturers and retail supply chains to a real time and in context live interaction with the merchandise, stock and service availability provided by any retail store at the edge.

454
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:49.560
The third point is the social uses of such infrastructures. Here we'll explain the facade by which social features will be leveraged to exploit and generate data from users, providers and IT systems.

455
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:57.840
It is more likely that these type of mechanisms and digital functioning will be exploited through social mobile applications based on geolocation.

456
01:13:58.590 --> 01:14:06.810
We believe that the best way to leverage big data analytics and pushing digitization with these mechanisms is by setting up open map mobile application.

457
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:08.910
That the user will use to navigate

458
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:23.580
geospatial data should be allowed to be interacted with from a local or non local point. Privately or publicly, doesn't really matter as long as data symbiosis is achieved in stored for advanced analytics to industry 4.0 designs and architectures.

459
01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:30.600
Public private and individualized services need to be available to achieve maximum capabilities of harnessing big data.

460
01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:36.330
Next point is the 5G, which is fifth generation technology standard for cellular networks.

461
01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:48.540
The implementation of 5G will be a game changer to the use of the systems as a few companies already started providing 5G wireless transmission, but we'll discuss this further in the presentation.

462
01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:54.840
Next we have the commercial systems, components that will bring the industry 4.0 in place.

463
01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:05.220
So first we have the vertical and horizontal integration systems that are key to automation of data transmission and smart factories, stores or any kind of commercial place.

464
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:09.690
Of course, this systems will be made up of more than only what is written here.

465
01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:18.840
Then we have the CPS system is defined by its processing, storing and communication capabilities that will control more than one physical process.

466
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:28.500
This system can also enable decentralized data analysis and decision making that will enable real time responses as it is interconnected through the Internet.

467
01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:44.220
Next up we have the big data and data analytics that will help processing and analyzing the huge amount of data generated by the users of the platform and thus bringing predictive data and solving futuristic problems and necessities. Then we have the simulation software.

468
01:15:45.330 --> 01:15:48.240
Process information to model behavior for

469
01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:51.060
future scenarios.

470
01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:57.540
Predict problems, reduce configuration costs and improve quality of services.

471
01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:08.010
But it sure has a limitation in the future.

472
01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:20.460
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: But we have different solutions such as funk computing. And of course, we have the cyber security aspect because without security and privacy, nothing will work.

473
01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:30.570
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: So this is the key to provide secure and reliable communications, authentication systems to preserve data and avoid any kind of cyber attacks.

474
01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:36.000
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: This is crucial to protect national security matters and industrial systems.

475
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:47.400
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Next up we have the social feature by which the geospatial data will be exploited and created, I believe that only of mobile application will be in measured in work such IT systems and infrastructures.

476
01:16:48.000 --> 01:17:00.840
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: So basic features would include private user groups, public user groups and individualized user groups so that one can be able to navigate through the system, and have access to the data no matter the location.

477
01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:08.610
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Geospatial data and interactive maps widgets should be available, no matter the location of the user using the platform.

478
01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:22.890
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: I believe it will also be good to implement different types of social media interconnection for other in app services such as social, public or private transportation using the maps to track and real time movement and interaction with any interactive geospatial data.

479
01:17:23.490 --> 01:17:30.630
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Also, we believe that other social media application can be interconnected to this system to achieve a greater data symbiosis.

480
01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:37.350
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: A few example for social or private activities or meetings, location routes, messaging and sharing moments.

481
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:43.020
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Also inter connecting with other social media application could leverage and harness valuable data.

482
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:54.000
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Next point was the 5G or the fifth generation technology for wireless telecommunication. The reason why this is here is because the rollout of 5G tech isn't coming

483
01:17:54.660 --> 01:18:04.020
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: There's already a few companies working on implementing such network as a standardized telecommunications networks and 5G will bring enormous changes to the games.

484
01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:16.710
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: It will change the data transfer speed by a lot so testing a network and framework as soon as possible to adjust to these changes and opportunities brought by the 5G is also crucial at this moment.

485
01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:20.940
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: This will provide customers with a greater network reliability.

486
01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:31.500
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: It'll also be a better use when 5G will be integrated to the advanced analytics with artificial intelligence Internet of Things for real time insights and recommendations.

487
01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:42.930
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: That will be the future of the next generation of digital industry or commerce with the 5G. Of course, this is merely the potential of what 5G could really do in the industry 4.0

488
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:51.810
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Next up, we'll be looking at the four principal identified as the integral to industry 4.0. The first one is the interconnection.

489
01:18:52.440 --> 01:19:00.540
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: It is the ability of the machines devices, sensors, and people to connect and communicate with each other via the Internet of Things, or internet of people

490
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:12.360
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Next one we have the information transparency, which is the transparency afforded by industry 4.0 technology providers, operators with comprehensive information to inform decisions.

491
01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:25.200
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: interconnectivity allows operators to collect immense amounts of data and information from all points in the manufacturing process, identify key areas that can benefit from improvement to increase functionality.

492
01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:30.600
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Then the technical assistance that will assist humans in decision making on problem solving.

493
01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:43.740
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: And the ability to help humans with some difficult and unsafe tasks. And finally, the decentralized decision, which is the ability of cyber physical systems to make decisions on their own and to perform their tasks as autonomously as possible.

494
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:50.130
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Finally, here in the conclusion, I'd like to discuss about the ethics behind such projects and craft.

495
01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:57.900
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Well, first of all, we're in an epic where every single polarity is shifting around us, and so, is how the technology is used from now on.

496
01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:08.910
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: I think it's really important to understand the laws and work by its code of ethics because this kind of IT system will shape a certain type of social behaviors globally from this point.

497
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:16.410
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: And will also methodically frame different types of procedure as the technology is applied, and this is barely what the system can do

498
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:24.570
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Also, ensuring the safety and security of such value systems, as a matter of national security. No matter what society will be using such technology.

499
01:20:25.230 --> 01:20:37.830
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: Also, I think it's the perfect time to develop share public data sets and environments for artificial intelligence training and testing because we're just starting moving into this new era of technology and the a lot of advancement are to be made.

500
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:51.360
Nicolas Rafael Palamino: And finally, we need to expand, whether public or private partnerships arrangements, to accelerate advances in artificial intelligence implementation for global use. Thanks for listening to my presentation.

501
01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:09.720
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Can people hear me?

502
01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:14.280
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Okay. Zoom is saying you can't. But, uh,

503
01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:15.600
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I'm glad you can.

504
01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:43.890
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: So that was Nicolas Rafael Palomino or his computer helping him with the English pronunciation, I guess, something like that. Nicolas is not here right now, it's a little too early for him, but he has been active in the chat before. So definitely leave your questions and

505
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:47.490
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I'm sure he will follow up. If

506
01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:57.150
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Any of those grand ideas struck your fancy our next talk upk, Danielle Dupuy

507
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:11.730
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Will be speaking on embedding the rendering and behavior configuration in map data. So, Danielle is a geographer with the US Geological Survey.

508
01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:32.070
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Who works with the California Water science centers groundwater ambient monitoring and assessment program, an important goal of that program is to increase the availability of quality information to the public and with that goal. Daniel has been working on.

509
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:39.990
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Building web mapping with a templated approach. So, Danielle. I'll let you take away

510
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:47.670
Danielle Dupuy: Okay. Hi. Um, I recorded my presentation. So I'm gonna just play it because it was a little late. I don't trust my brain at this hour.

511
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:48.990
Amelia Bellamy Royds: This is great.

512
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:51.660
Danielle Dupuy: So let me know if

513
01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:56.580
Danielle Dupuy: They can see everything. And I thought, audio will go through

514
01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:57.840
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I can see it.

515
01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:58.890
Danielle Dupuy: Okay.

516
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:07.800
Danielle Dupuy: Today I'm going to be sharing something that our team has been doing and helping to streamline our map development process. We've been including some maps

517
01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:14.280
Danielle Dupuy: Rendering and behavior components indoor map data rather than included into the HTML or JavaScript directly

518
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:22.560
Danielle Dupuy: So this concept itself is pretty simple. But this exact approach is something that I haven't seen talked about or seen any examples online.

519
01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:37.080
Danielle Dupuy: So it's something new to you that you find useful. And maybe you can implement into your own maps and before we go any further, I just want to introduce you to acknowledge my colleague, Dan. He's an IT specialist with the USGS's

520
01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:52.080
Danielle Dupuy: Western Ecological Research Center, and he was the web developer that helped our department with its maps before I joined the team last year. And so this approach that I'm going to be talking about today was something that he actually came up with and implemented into our workflow.

521
01:23:56.310 --> 01:24:10.500
So I'm going to be kind of going over why we started doing this and what benefits we've been seen and how we found it useful. And then I'll go over some examples of how we've been implementing this and show you some code of what we've been doing

522
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:21.240
So as I said before, Dan was the one who started implementing this, and he was doing this before I joined the team. And part of the reason was because

523
01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:35.610
He's part of our center's web development team and he wasn't, his full time wasn't to be working on our smaller team's maps, and he wasn't really intimately familiar with the data that he's been asked to disply

524
01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:46.740
So this was kind of his way of allowing the scientists to author the data and who wanted these maps created to still have some control over some of the design aspects and

525
01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:58.980
Be able to make tweaks to the map appearance themselves. And so, you know, it allowed people to who don't have the knowledge or the access to directly edit the map.

526
01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:07.710
To kind of play around with color renderings move items around and the legend on their own and it worked well with our system because these changes.

527
01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:18.960
That the scientists could make in the database where they had access to, will then be immediately reflected on to our live staging sites. So if they wanted to change color, they can see it

528
01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:34.110
Instantly, you know, on the map and make changes and kind of in turn, this allowed our scientists to have control of this these aspects, without having to put in request to our developer

529
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:53.640
Seen in our case, Dan's working on many different projects and could only be working on stuff for our smaller team for, you know, limited amount of time. So this kind of took off some of the burden off of him and allowed our scientists to just make these changes on their own.

530
01:25:54.750 --> 01:26:03.570
And when I joined the team a year ago, my role was kind of bridging the gap between the scientists and the web developers, I'm

531
01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:11.700
Pretty much a GIS person and I work on all aspects of this data. So I'm definitely much more familiar it with than Dan was

532
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:19.290
So I kind of thought that maybe I would be using this approach less because I kind of had more knowledge and control over the maps

533
01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:28.260
And the way that we were presenting the data. But in reality, I've actually expanded how we've used to this. And I'm using it more and I still find it very useful.

534
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:40.830
I found that I can kind of have more control over some aspects of the map rendering with writing less code or like traditionally, I would have to write a bunch of if statements to say

535
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:50.970
Apply colors. Based on a study type for for points that are being displayed, but using this approach, I can do all that with one fell swoop.

536
01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:58.020
Danielle Dupuy: You know, using the color information that you store with the data that you're feeding into the site.

537
01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:07.110
And you know, I just simply find it easier to make changes to these database values than having to go into the map code.

538
01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:17.430
It's kind of, you know, like, go find and replace but I just kind of find it easier to be looking at it in a table and it's just a much easier workflow for me.

539
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:28.380
And then, you know, I think this kind of approach kind of opens up the door, as a way to kind of almost automate or kind of greatly reduce the effort needed to create new maps.

540
01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:39.840
Where I see it is less unique items that you put into your app code, the easier it is to reuse that code for a new map that has a similar structure.

541
01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:46.110
One of the cool things about this approach is that the possibilities are endless.

542
01:27:46.620 --> 01:28:00.060
So here's some examples, things that we've been using in our maps, but it's by no means a finite list. We've even used some of the map data to populate HTML IDs and then use those to render

543
01:28:00.690 --> 01:28:16.560
Checkbox toggles based on the study types present in our data sets. And so, you know, if the map data changes and we no longer have a certain study type, it just won't be implemented into the map, but we don't have to go in and change any HTML code.

544
01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:31.800
I'm going to show you how we use the map data to render the appearance of the site here. So we include in the map data all the information for these points, the colors, the sizes, the shapes.

545
01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:46.620
Even kind of a plane they're drawn onm like the draw order and also the sidebar here on the left, we've used some of the map data to render the toggle boxes and the points displayed here.

546
01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:56.190
We use a SQL server database to store data and then we use stored procedures to serve that data to our .NET sites.

547
01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:06.450
So that's what's going on here in this table. This is kind of where we store the rendering information. We typically store it in a like legend item table.

548
01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:21.480
And here we include all of the unique colors are symbols that would go correspond with our data. So in this map we had these 11 study types and each of them needs to be uniquely identified so we

549
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:30.360
Changed symbol for each of the study classes and then a unique color for each study pipe and we also included the draw order.

550
01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:41.640
Kind of the pane, the Leaflet be the stories and the Leaflet map. So it was the Leaflet pane which kind of identified which order the layers would be drawn on the map.

551
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:43.290
So,

552
01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:57.150
Here is an example of the printout of our actual map data, the point data. So it's typical to how you would feed your data into a map, but then we add in

553
01:29:57.570 --> 01:30:12.270
The colors, the each of the symbols, the each of the data points, but get along with the Symbol, Symbol size and the draw order. So here is an example of a web method that we use to read that.

554
01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:23.010
From here I just use an AJAX request to read the data and then I apply the rendering information to the Leaflet marker options.

555
01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:42.330
And by doing it this way. I was able to create are able to add that unique rendering for each of the data types without having to do any if statements. So I was able to do it all in one go. And then I applied these micro options into the points and create a layer.

556
01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:49.410
And then from there, the only kind of if statements that we had to do is because each study ID or each study type

557
01:30:49.950 --> 01:31:03.450
Had to be a unique layer that we can toggle on and off. I just had to apply it to a layer group that I had already created. So this was kind of the only information that I had to hard code which still worked for us, but maybe could be changed in the future.

558
01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:14.610
So here's another example, and this is how I created that left side panel. I did the same thing use an AJAX request to read the data and

559
01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:28.020
Over here, I'm just using that information from the database to populate some of the HTML that's going to go and create a table on the side and kind of create the checkboxes.

560
01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:38.700
It's toggle checkboxes. And then I just insert that into some divs that I had already written into the HTML code of the map.

561
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:45.870
So this here is the map that we just created, that code got the nice sidebar that was

562
01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:56.250
with the check boxes. But you know, I noticed that the groundwater, because there's so many data points here. It was overwhelming all the other data layers and since it was drawn on

563
01:31:56.670 --> 01:32:09.900
In pane 4, drawn on last it is overwhelming everything else. So it's super easy just to go into the database and just change that pane here to be drawn first.

564
01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:19.860
I was easily able to just change the draw order around on all of the layers and create a much better looking map without having to touch the code at all.

565
01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:32.190
So that's it. It's pretty easy, but it could save our team a bunch of time and if it's used in the right way, I think it can open up the doors for some pretty cool stuff down the line.

566
01:32:34.050 --> 01:32:40.830
Like our team has a lot of data that we want to put into web maps and, you know, I've been working on kind of code that

567
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:56.070
Can easily be reused to create new maps faster. Usually, you know, our maps show discrete water samples. So for map, map things look pretty simple, just with minor tweaks to address the specific data and the story that needs to be told.

568
01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:07.740
But I think that using this we can kind of get to a point where most of the unique elements can be included in the map data in the database and then we couple that with kind of a generic template.

569
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:15.900
And we can have a new map up and running in a matter of days as opposed to weeks or months. So, you know,

570
01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:31.680
Hopefully we can kind of get close to an automated system. Maybe it's a little far fetched to be completely, you know, automated and just be pumping out maps every day. But I think this kind of get us closer so thanks for your time and I hope you found this helpful.

571
01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:41.520
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Thank you to Danielle, the live one and then recorded one

572
01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:53.190
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Um, I don't think we've started a Discourse page up for the topic, but I definitely think there is lots to say about it and

573
01:33:54.360 --> 01:34:05.970
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: People who are doing similar things or who might even want to convince you to create a JSON-LD schema to standardize this, I don't know, something like that.

574
01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.970
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: But moving right along, because we

575
01:34:08.970 --> 01:34:13.320
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Are tight for time. Our next presenter is Chris Little

576
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:16.500
Chris Little: Hi, can you hear me clearly?

577
01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:18.030
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Chris Little, yes, you

578
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:20.670
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Are coming in, loud and clear and Chris

579
01:34:20.730 --> 01:34:22.830
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Is a professional meteorologist of

580
01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:32.400
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Many years at the Met Office UK and works on standards at both W3C and OGC and

581
01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:44.070
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Chris is going to present us a very brief history of meteorology and cartography, so that we know where we have been, so we know where we can go

582
01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:50.400
Chris Little: Okay, so should I be presenting from my screen or from things been uploaded.

583
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:54.420
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: If you got it, that would be great. Otherwise, I have to find it.

584
01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:59.010
Chris Little: Fine. Okay, no, I've got it, I've just got to find

585
01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:02.970
Chris Little: My Zoom controls share screen. Okay.

586
01:35:05.370 --> 01:35:05.850
Chris Little: Hello.

587
01:35:13.230 --> 01:35:14.940
Chris Little: Do I need permission from you to share the screen.

588
01:35:15.570 --> 01:35:16.650
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Oh, you shouldn't?

589
01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:30.330
Chris Little: I've got a share screen, select screen. Remember this decision window screen. Okay. Yeah. Okay, I've got select the window right here. Okay.

590
01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:35.970
Chris Little: What's not working. I

591
01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:38.310
Chris Little: Don't know.

592
01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:41.040
Chris Little: I'm not a Zoom person

593
01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:45.120
Chris Little: Why is it not allowing

594
01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:49.830
Chris Little: Oh, Firefox is stopping me. Drat.

595
01:35:56.310 --> 01:36:00.060
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I've got PDFs. You want me to share and you can just tell me when

596
01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.320
Move Ahead. Yep.

597
01:36:03.570 --> 01:36:05.460
Chris Little: Maybe bit tedious because I have a  lot of pictures.

598
01:36:08.670 --> 01:36:11.130
Chris Little: I didn't realize Firefox was so strict

599
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.680
Chris Little: Okay.

600
01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:17.970
Chris Little: Cannot allow permit access to your screen.

601
01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:22.140
Chris Little: Nope, okay. Firefox is just not let me do it.

602
01:36:24.930 --> 01:36:27.030
Chris Little: Okay, so can you just show the PDF

603
01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:29.640
Chris Little: Right next.

604
01:36:33.330 --> 01:36:33.930
Chris Little: To the screen.

605
01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:39.390
Chris Little: So that's the structure of the talk. It's not, okay, it's

606
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:46.230
Chris Little: Okay, very straightforward. Timeline, next

607
01:36:48.570 --> 01:36:49.380
Chris Little: Okay, this is

608
01:36:51.360 --> 01:37:01.710
Chris Little: 3500 years ago. This is a map for Mesopotamia. It's not the earliest map, though it's not disputed that it is a map. Next.

609
01:37:05.970 --> 01:37:13.350
Chris Little: And all talks about the history of meteorology involve the first documented weather forecast. This is Noah,

610
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:21.600
Chris Little: It's a mosaic from St. Marks in Venice. And the important thing about this is not that it was a

611
01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:25.560
Chris Little: weather forecast that was accurate. It was a long range weather forecast.

612
01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:31.470
Chris Little: Of the authoritative voice that gave the weather forecast. It's the fact that Noah acted

613
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:40.020
Chris Little: On the forecast. If you're not going to change your behavior because of the weather forecast. There's no point having a weather forecast. Next slide.

614
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:45.750
Chris Little: And these are the people who didn't listen to forecast and didn't pay attention to it. Right, so

615
01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:47.970
Chris Little: Next,

616
01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:57.660
Chris Little: So meteorology starts becoming documented about two and a half thousand years ago, 500BC with Aristotle.

617
01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:02.700
Chris Little: He wrote a document called Meteorologica.

618
01:38:04.590 --> 01:38:07.560
Chris Little: From word and meteors, meteors being things you see in the sky.

619
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.360
And

620
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:20.850
Chris Little: It the document came down to us via the Arabic actually, it was translated into Arabic for Arabic scholars and then got translated back into Latin after the fall of Constantinople and this is

621
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:24.690
Chris Little: Aristotle's worldview.

622
01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:43.020
Chris Little: He lived in a temperate blue zone on the sphere. It was hot as you went south, because you got close to the sun. It's cold at the north. And from arguments of symmetry there must be a temperate and a cold zone at the bottom, which is actually rather good actually for 500BC. Next.

623
01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.930
Chris Little: And then cartography, meteorology sort stayed where it was. Aristotle was taken as

624
01:38:51.480 --> 01:39:05.130
Chris Little: As the word for a few thousand years but cartography improved. This is an Arabic chart. Don't try to read Arabic as it's upside down because I put north at the top, as they preferred to put south at the top. Next.

625
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:08.670
Chris Little: And then we have

626
01:39:10.650 --> 01:39:15.330
Chris Little: This one from the Byzantine Empire and just built on Ptolemy's, you know the Egyptian,

627
01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:33.660
Chris Little: His map and you can see we start to get we've got latitude, longitude lines I skipped about an hour's talk with of cartography and its history. Missed out all of the Chinese maps, where in 200AD they were putting grids and scales on their maps so you could measure distances.

628
01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:38.160
Chris Little: We've gotten distances on here. Next.

629
01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:48.210
Chris Little: And then all change with this guy. This guy is Mercator, Gerardus Mercator. Next.

630
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:58.080
Chris Little: And of course he produced the Mercator map. And the important thing about this, this is only 60 years after Columbus went to America and they more or less got the shape of america right after 60 years

631
01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:08.160
Chris Little: And the important thing about the map, of course, is if you sail on a constant bearing with your compass, you follow a straight line on the map. And it made global

632
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:19.590
Chris Little: Navigation, much, much easier. Next, and now we get to when meteorology starts paying attention. And again, I've missed out about an hour's worth of talk on

633
01:40:21.150 --> 01:40:23.880
Chris Little: The history of meteorology and enlightenment and

634
01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:41.790
Chris Little: Arising from the Renaissance and everybody's wish to measure everything you know all the stuff about Boyle and Hooke and inventing thermometers and Torricelli inventing his barometer. This is Edmond Halley, the Astronomer Royal of the

635
01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:55.140
Chris Little: Comet fame. But before we made this fame over the comet, He said, like ship called Paramour across the Atlantic as a young man, and came back and published the next map.

636
01:40:59.370 --> 01:41:08.250
Chris Little: So this is probably the first weather map, it's of trade winds, and what's interesting here is we've now got accurate map. And we've got arrows on it.

637
01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:26.250
Chris Little: Showing direction and speed because big strong winds, longer arrows. That's a key point. And again, I'm going to miss out about an hour's worth of talk on scientific visualization and and which is generally driven by the French. Next.

638
01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:32.790
Chris Little: But this guy. You may have heard of called Lambert

639
01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:46.170
Chris Little: Swiss mathematician, polymath, went to school with Gauss and he suggested you should be plotting the weather on maps to figure out what's going on next.

640
01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.750
Chris Little: And invented some weather symbols.

641
01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:51.960
Chris Little: And actually, that's pretty good, actually, they've

642
01:41:53.670 --> 01:41:56.760
Chris Little: Kept continuity with some of the symbols for a long time. Next.

643
01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:02.100
Chris Little: And the French came in with just a pure

644
01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:09.450
Chris Little: Orography, and we know about 1700, and

645
01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:20.340
Chris Little: Someone invented the contour map before then it's just hashing and this is the quantitative contour map that first occurred. I've left in a lot of

646
01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:39.690
Chris Little: notes in the original PowerPoint, that has all this detail and so I'll post that later, might solve the problem of the slides, but now, this guy is the most famous scientist at the Brits have never heard of, that's a self portrait by him and that of course is Humbold, next map.

647
01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:48.450
Chris Little: He went, he had some adventures voyages as a young man, and more self single handedly invented geography

648
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:50.880
Chris Little: And climatology, next map.

649
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:58.560
Chris Little: And cause to be published this map showing isotherms, lines of equal temperature

650
01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:02.580
Chris Little: And next

651
01:43:05.250 --> 01:43:08.160
Chris Little: And then towards the end of the

652
01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:14.670
Chris Little: 18th century, a guy called Brandes, who published a weather map.

653
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:24.390
Chris Little: This is the weather for the date of 6th of March, 1783. The main problem is, he took 30 years to produce it.

654
01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:36.420
Chris Little: Actually published in 1816. and unfortunately I haven't been able to find an image of what he looked like. So that's the first daily weather map. It's an optic weather map, took 30 years next

655
01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:46.020
Chris Little: Now things get interesting. You all know who this is, this is Admiral Beaufort, chief Hydrographer. And of course,

656
01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:54.900
Chris Little: Responsible for a large chunk, a large part of British Navy and he invented the weather code. Next.

657
01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:08.070
Chris Little: So that all the ships captain's writing their logs and wanted to record that it was foggy and rainy, and windy, just used the code, and it was standardized across all the Navy and next slide.

658
01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:26.580
Chris Little: It also standardized how to record the wind speed, which is interesting because this is using qualitative information to give a quantitative answer. and of course that is still used in a slight variation to this day. And the other thing that

659
01:44:27.630 --> 01:44:30.390
Chris Little: Admiral Beaufort did is he sent the next person

660
01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:34.800
Chris Little: On the voyage. And that's Fitzroy

661
01:44:36.150 --> 01:44:36.600
Chris Little: Next,

662
01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:46.710
Chris Little: Fitzroy went on that journey for three years around the world mapping the oceans, because they were, you know, hazards to shipping if we don't know where the reefs are

663
01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:49.080
Chris Little: Next.

664
01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:57.450
Chris Little: And of course, he took a young scientists within this guy who in the next slide, you'll recognize him. Darwin.

665
01:44:58.560 --> 01:44:58.890
Chris Little: Next,

666
01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:09.900
Chris Little: When Fitzroy, came back he eventually became vice admiral. He set up the Meteorological Service in the UK. He was the official chief meteorological statist.

667
01:45:10.590 --> 01:45:23.880
Chris Little: And he had the bright idea, you could actually predict the weather. He didn't like the idea of using the word prediction. Prediction, he thought was a bit too precise. So he called it forecasting he invented the word forecasting.

668
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:29.190
Chris Little: Forecasting gave this idea of slightly less accurate than a prediction.

669
01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:31.080
Chris Little: Next.

670
01:45:34.050 --> 01:45:53.010
Chris Little: Over in the US. This is Lieutenant Maury in the US Navy. He was no longer active service, damaged his leg. He collected a lot of information from sailors and he produced atlases to make sailing safer. Next slide. He produced the first oceanographic

671
01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:14.910
Chris Little: [inaudible] of the Atlantic. The first map of an ocean basin. Right. And he also no, go back again just back to Maury. He was the first person to he caused an international conference to be held in Brussels in 1853 to standardize the data.

672
01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:21.870
Chris Little: And 11 countries attended, and they all agreed on the standard form for measuring data from ships at sea.

673
01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:31.380
Chris Little: And so, meteorologists, we've been used to using interoperable data and services for at least 150 years

674
01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.090
Chris Little: Next slide.

675
01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:44.970
Chris Little: This is Galton, a scientist who caught Fitzroy to be defunded because he didn't like his forecasting because there's no science in it.

676
01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:57.720
Chris Little: It was just seat of the pants experience, saying, you know, west wind is followed by Northwest wind, no science at all. He's very eminent scientists, but a bit out of favor because invented eugenics.

677
01:46:59.130 --> 01:47:08.610
Chris Little: But he invented correlation. He discovers fingerprints and he did twin studies and invented the term anticyclone. Next slide. And he produced some maps.

678
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:13.080
Chris Little: So here's a map of the weather on the

679
01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:33.780
Chris Little: January 1861, and he's kind of constrained by type setting. So he had some type made, and the printer had to set them, and print the document. Next slide. And of course, if he didn't have observations, but he had kind of coverage, in the mapping terminology, a field.

680
01:47:35.370 --> 01:47:44.910
Chris Little: Not very effective. But it's what best he could do with printing. Next, and he also collected the weather observations by train

681
01:47:47.040 --> 01:48:04.530
Chris Little: But telegraph was coming into effect as well, electric telegraph, not optical telegraph. And orthography was invented, lithography allowed you to draw pictures on stone, rotary lithography became widespread use in the 1850s-1860s. So newspapers could print pictures.

682
01:48:05.550 --> 01:48:10.200
Chris Little: And so then you start getting daily weather maps, and they're still usable, isobars, they got arrows.

683
01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:17.190
Chris Little: And there's been a daily weather the map for the UK every day since. Next.

684
01:48:19.050 --> 01:48:29.850
Chris Little: Now, that's kind of history, and meteorology is not a science. So next slide, this all changed 120 years ago. This is Vilhelm Bjerknes, next.

685
01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:36.570
Chris Little: He wrote down the equations of the motions of the atmosphere. Next, don't worry about them. They're tough.

686
01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:49.500
Chris Little: And they were first solved by hand by Lewis Fry Richardson, this guy's quaker, worked as an ambulance in the First World War. He spent six weeks solving those equations. Next slide.

687
01:48:50.730 --> 01:48:56.910
Chris Little: On this four by four grid, at four levels and atmosphere. He had level, he had information on the

688
01:48:58.050 --> 01:49:03.510
Chris Little: Depth of the atmosphere from artillery soundings by balloon from first World War.

689
01:49:05.010 --> 01:49:08.640
Chris Little: So on this four by four grid, he did a calculation to six weeks. Next slide.

690
01:49:09.810 --> 01:49:15.270
Chris Little: He used this hand calculator, took him six weeks for a six hour forecast.

691
01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:19.770
Chris Little: Which is bit better than 30 days, uh, 30 years to produce a weather forecast

692
01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:28.260
Chris Little: Unfortunately, his weather forecast was completely wrong. Not in just slightly wrong, it was completely wrong wasn't even meteorological

693
01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:33.750
Chris Little: But the important thing was, he published his results in 1922, six years later.

694
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:39.960
Chris Little: And they didn't know why the equations were wrong, why he got the wrong answer. Next slide.

695
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.600
Chris Little: Then things changed, during,

696
01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:44.160
Chris Little: Next,

697
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:47.160
Chris Little: Jules Charney,

698
01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:55.410
Chris Little: Child of Russian immigrants, lived in California, brilliant mathematician and very influential in meteorology, next

699
01:49:57.180 --> 01:50:07.440
Chris Little: Figured out what was wrong with Bjerknes's equations. They had sound waves in them, which kind of mucked up the answers. You don't want the whole atmosphere vibrating as a

700
01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:14.760
Chris Little: Very loud sound, you filter those out and you get a bit more meteoroligical next

701
01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:35.730
Chris Little: So von Neumann, Hungarian, decided, next, weather forecasting along with one or two other things we were competing on ENIAC, one of the first computers whole 'nother hours worth of lecture on history of computing and who was first, and who was not first, next

702
01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:45.690
Chris Little: And it did weather forecast on a 270 point grid for North America. It took 24 hours on ENIAC, it took took several weeks to set up a computer.

703
01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:52.050
Chris Little: But ENIAC took 24 hours to do a 24 hour forecast, and it was not wrong.

704
01:50:53.370 --> 01:50:57.120
Chris Little: It wasn't particularly good, but it wasn't wrong, so point proved next

705
01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:11.790
Chris Little: And Moore's Law, souls rest, as the grids get finer, the focus get better, and as computers get faster we can do finer grid. Next slide. By the way, should say on the end of that slide

706
01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:30.540
Chris Little: Moore's Law, still adhering, we're still adhering to it, the CrayXC40 fits on the line at the top right hand corner, so 2020 CrayXC40. And the weather forecasts have got better and better. So this is the main square error of pressure of the Atlantic and you can see over 30 years

707
01:51:31.650 --> 01:51:45.330
Chris Little: The forecast got much better the horizontal purple line is persistence. That's how accurate forecast is if you say, today's the same as tomorrow will be the same as today, which is what you're trying to beat. Next. Now,

708
01:51:47.250 --> 01:51:47.490
Chris Little: Look,

709
01:51:49.470 --> 01:52:00.000
Chris Little: Then as computers developed. That's the Swedes had the bright idea of producing a zebra chart, that's a global map from the North Pole, in the middle. Next.

710
01:52:02.610 --> 01:52:19.290
Chris Little: That's a Russian chart, of now we've got plotting by hand, and then drawing lines on a big piece of paper, 'bout A0 size, but you can't read it as it's in Russian. But the symbols are all standardized and have been standardized for a long time. So any meteorologists can use it. Next.

711
01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:31.920
Chris Little: He's German chart, again you've got the plotted observations, you got the contours drawn by hand and got the fronts which computers are not very good at fronts because they, discontinuities. Next.

712
01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:42.090
Chris Little: And of course, this is all completely different from the development of GIS and geospatial and mapping systems because they're meteorological

713
01:52:43.050 --> 01:53:00.060
Chris Little: And this is a more up to date one because we've included satellite imagery in the clouds, and we've got all the layers. This now online is not on paper, it's on a screen, we can switch the layerss off and on. And of course, then you start switching off some of the layers to make the map make more sense. Next.

714
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:11.310
Chris Little: So you've removed some of the stuff, you've got the winds. You got the arrows, you've got multiple layers of pressure, temperature and there is rain, for example.

715
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:16.680
Chris Little: And that's a very standard meteorological chart, and next.

716
01:53:19.230 --> 01:53:28.740
Chris Little: Of course, you remove even more data to give the chart or the map to the users. This is a standard chart given to all airline pilots.

717
01:53:29.130 --> 01:53:38.760
Chris Little: All pilots in the world would receive a significant weather chart, remove all spurious stuff and left in the stuff that only important to the pilot the significant weather,

718
01:53:39.330 --> 01:53:58.110
Chris Little: The strong winds, the base of the clouds, the height of the clouds, where the clouds are, where the thunderstorms are and turbulence, and actually on that map halfway down the left hand side you can see Etna is erupting right, so little volcano there so. Okay, next.

719
01:54:00.810 --> 01:54:05.700
Chris Little: And that's where we've been, right, so then this is the rude part of the talk.

720
01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:13.170
Chris Little: In the 1980s, I was asked to give do a 30 day demonstration of

721
01:54:14.370 --> 01:54:19.470
Chris Little: A piece of GIS software. In the 80s, GIS software was not to be popular.

722
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:21.330
Chris Little: There's no internet,

723
01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:30.600
Chris Little: There was no mobile phones, we're starting to get mini computers at work, and we though we didn't use them for weather forecasting.

724
01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:37.620
Chris Little: Spent a couple of weeks, getting the data from the mainframe supercomputer down onto the mini computer

725
01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:39.480
Chris Little: That's another story.

726
01:54:40.590 --> 01:54:46.170
Chris Little: Guy came into this 30 day trial of this be software we run it on, I think it's a DEC 11-750,

727
01:54:47.610 --> 01:54:56.820
Chris Little: VAX-11/750, took about an hour to produce the best weather map I've ever seen. Beautiful chart, beautiful contours, contours all labeled right way up.

728
01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:05.130
Chris Little: And I then said, and he's then said, well, oh that's fantastic. I've never seen a weather map from a geospatial information system and

729
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:18.750
Chris Little: he said 'Are you going to buy the software'. And I said 'no' and he said 'why' I said because 'it's just taken an hour to produce that chart. This is the biggest mini computer we got so can produce 24 charts a day. We're already producing 100,000 charts a day'.

730
01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:26.970
Chris Little: So so niche use of geospatial software systems stayed niche in meteorology for decades.

731
01:55:28.110 --> 01:55:36.000
Chris Little: Just for specific products where you needed really fancy maps, while we chugged along with our thousands and thousands of maps, but then

732
01:55:36.690 --> 01:55:49.590
Chris Little: 10 years ago we got involved in GIS, because we discovered exchanging maps with Web Map Services was feasible. So we've got involved, and that's more or less where we are now. We've been very involved in OGC and W3C

733
01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:53.580
Chris Little: Next slide. I'm running out of time.

734
01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:59.310
Chris Little: Oh, so. So here's my thoughts, where we should be going now.

735
01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:01.350
Chris Little: Okay, next.

736
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:13.500
Chris Little: Meteorology had this long history of tweaking technology, using technology, changing it. We used to write our own operating systems, we used to write our own programming languages.

737
01:56:14.010 --> 01:56:21.960
Chris Little: We had our own telecoms protocols, because the mainstream ones weren't good enough, or fast enough and we stopped doing that now as they've got good enough.

738
01:56:23.070 --> 01:56:26.040
Chris Little: We've had our own data formats for 30-40 years

739
01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:30.750
Chris Little: They're quite advanced scientific, container format. They're useful.

740
01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:33.360
Chris Little: And I can take the blame for some of them.

741
01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:46.860
Chris Little: And we're starting to move away from those two generic ones but visualization, as I've just shown you is still very specialized and the semantics is totally specialized, but actually visualization and semantics is exactly where GIS's are

742
01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:48.840
Chris Little: Next,

743
01:56:51.120 --> 01:57:03.090
Chris Little: So these are he problems we don't have gigabytes of data, we have petabytes of data. The data is 3D and 4D. It's constantly changing. We've got multiple time attributes.

744
01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:14.010
Chris Little: Time intervals are irregular, time scales are very varied from climate predictions over centuries, and we go backwards and forwards in time.

745
01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:24.570
Chris Little: We've got vertical coordinates and they're not height above sea level or height above the terrain, they are pressure levels, aircraft fly on pressure levels. They don't fly on an altitude.

746
01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:36.840
Chris Little: And we are not averse to say, well, let's make the equator go through Paris, we put the North Pole in the middle of the Pacific and will bend

747
01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:48.450
Chris Little: South Pole, so it's in the South Pacific. That's kind of thing we do right, that upsets geographers. And the other thing we do, of course, is we produced thousands of forecasts for the same time on some books.

748
01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:55.620
Chris Little: Well, maybe hundreds, next slide. So they're all problematic for large scale map production.

749
01:57:56.730 --> 01:57:58.770
Chris Little: And that trend is going to continue

750
01:58:00.930 --> 01:58:08.340
Chris Little: As, as we can afford the next computer resolutions, going to improve global models are currently running about 10 kilometer grid.

751
01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:24.900
Chris Little: And it will slowly come down to a high resolution, nested grids running at one kilometer, they may go to lower than that, not much below because you then get into problems with turbulence. So data is going to get bigger and bigger. We routinely blending it with lots of other people's data.

752
01:58:27.390 --> 01:58:34.500
Chris Little: And we're kind of moving away from our domain specific solutions to more generic solutions which is where W3C comes in, of course.

753
01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:52.470
Chris Little: And of course, we've got our own visualization so. Next slide. We're getting towards the end. The problem we have with GIS systems and maps and cartography is layers don't cut it for us. We've had one of the saddest things I see is

754
01:58:53.520 --> 01:59:01.470
Chris Little: A mapping specialist in the last four or five years coming on, say, oh, look, we put a time slider and a vertical slider on our mapping software.

755
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:04.650
Chris Little: And I say oh sorry, we've been doing it for 30 years, right.

756
01:59:05.970 --> 01:59:06.540
Chris Little: And if you've got

757
01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:21.000
Chris Little: 100 levels in the atmosphere, 110 levels in the atmosphere. You got 10 data times, every, the forecast for every six hours for next four or five days you've got 1100 levels.

758
01:59:22.230 --> 01:59:29.430
Chris Little: Not a 1100 levels, parameters,  you're interested in, you're talking about millions of layers. There's no way I'm going to select those off a legend, right. So, so the layer

759
01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:33.150
Chris Little: Metaphor is broken for us. Next

760
01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:41.760
Chris Little: Now if I look at what's going on inside OGC, which is about interoperability standards for

761
01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:50.760
Chris Little: Mapping. There's a lot of 3D activity going on. We've got flight simulation. We've got gaming, we've got

762
01:59:52.440 --> 02:00:03.090
Chris Little: unmanned vehicles in particular drones, both above ground on ground and below ground, underwater. We've got underwater model, underground modeling going on for tunneling

763
02:00:04.230 --> 02:00:13.050
Chris Little: We've got smart cities, 3D portrayal of smart cities and none of those are based on the traditional 2D cartography, they're all completely

764
02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:15.180
Chris Little: Coming from a different place.

765
02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:23.820
Chris Little: And there's still this attempt to say 'we can get to 3D by starting from 2D and adding the extra dimensions'.

766
02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:40.590
Chris Little: Where you can sort of, but actually it's much easier to start from 3D because, for example on the previous talk from Danielle, I thought was very interesting that she's kind of reinventing in JavaScript, and JSON, all the stuff that the hardware is already doing in the GPU.

767
02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:59.760
Chris Little: GPUs in most devices, phones and laptops, are designed to do 3D graphics. They've got hardware to do 3D graphics, and actually it's more work to do it in 2D. You have to solve yeah, zero out some of the mixes, but they all agree, yeah, they're all set up to do it.

768
02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:18.300
Chris Little: So in a sense, I'm treating the view that we should really be doing mapping in 3D. And then if you just look downwards, you see the 2D map. And of course that solves some fundamental problems, if it's in 3D, you don't have any problems about whether the red road goes over the blue river.

769
02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:27.690
Chris Little: Or under the black railway track. That problem of drawing things on maps and the drawing order just goes away.

770
02:01:28.890 --> 02:01:32.190
Chris Little: It's in 3D. And when you when you do the projection

771
02:01:34.050 --> 02:01:36.810
Chris Little: Then get the right drawing order.

772
02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:43.590
Chris Little: Of course, then if you do in 3D, you do vertical maps, cross sections, which are important meteorology. Next.

773
02:01:46.410 --> 02:01:48.870
Chris Little: So, so this is my last slide.

774
02:01:50.010 --> 02:01:59.340
Chris Little: Where do you want, where do, where do you think we're going to go, what is technology allows us to go. I think in five years time, we won't have any meteorological software anymore.

775
02:01:59.790 --> 02:02:10.680
Chris Little: We've there's been a big industry of it, and it slowly diminishing, fewer and fewer players, more, more sophisticated just become GIS systems, generic software and meteorological style sheets.

776
02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:17.700
Chris Little: The real issue in any visualization is handling the data, not actually the visualization

777
02:02:19.230 --> 02:02:33.840
Chris Little: In 10 years. Well, the GIS Systems be, and I'm just going to posit that there won't be any GIS systems, all the browsers will be doing it, browsers will be aware of where you are, and that all data will be geospatial

778
02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:38.310
Chris Little: And that's my view, really, the rest of it. I'm waiving.

779
02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:45.810
Chris Little: So I think really the important thing is that the vertical and time has to become first class citizens in the mapping world.

780
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:50.010
Chris Little: Right, so that's where I'm going to stop.

781
02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:52.800
Chris Little: Next slide, any questions.


783
02:02:59.370 --> 02:03:00.930
Chris Little: I hope I didn't run too much.

784
02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:13.620
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Well, we're all over running today. So I'm going to say questions can go on to Gitter or Discourse, you're going to continue along with our

785
02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:34.260
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Last talk of the day. So let me get my notes. Sajeevan G is Associate Director at see doc, the Center for development of Advanced Computing, which is associated with the government of India.

786
02:03:34.770 --> 02:03:48.990
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: He has more than 25 years in geospatial domain, he will be speaking to us about web GIS application for the Indian Prime Minister's rural road program. Sajeevan, welcome.

787
02:03:50.130 --> 02:03:50.490
Sajeevan G: Hi.

788
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:52.230
Sajeevan G: Is it audible?

789
02:03:52.590 --> 02:03:53.850
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Yes, we can hear you.

790
02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:54.930
Sajeevan G: Ah,

791
02:03:57.390 --> 02:03:58.830
Sajeevan G: Can I share my screen.

792
02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:04.830
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: I can see it.

793
02:04:12.690 --> 02:04:13.380
Sajeevan G: Good to go?

794
02:04:14.490 --> 02:04:15.180
Sajeevan G: Is it okay?

795
02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:16.050
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: All good.

796
02:04:16.890 --> 02:04:31.050
Sajeevan G: Okay. So the topic is web JS application for Indian Prime Minister's rural road programme. I am Sajeevan, we are into high performance computing, C-DAC is

797
02:04:32.730 --> 02:04:50.400
Sajeevan G: Since inception in 2003- sorry, 1988, we are into high performance computing and close to 3000 people all over India, and my group is working on geospatial technologies and

798
02:04:52.890 --> 02:04:54.390
Sajeevan G: Let me and the...

799
02:04:57.180 --> 02:05:05.580
Sajeevan G: OK, so I'll be talking about Prime Minister's rural road program. So I always I will be referring to PMGSY, PMGSY stands for

800
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:16.500
Sajeevan G: Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana in Indian language ,and the progress the pictures, what do you see in the photographs etc in the left side

801
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:26.790
Sajeevan G: speaks about the importance of the rural road program, launched by government of India to provide all better road connectivity to unconnected rural habitations.

802
02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:38.970
Sajeevan G: You could see the, you will see the starting 2000, the year 2000, the PMGSY, I always be referring to PMGSY for the Prime Minister

803
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:45.720
Sajeevan G: Rural Road Program. So that is has changed the face of the rural India with quality roads.

804
02:05:46.350 --> 02:05:55.890
Sajeevan G: previously made, you used to have really very bad roads in India, the quality of road is really commendable and the program is funded by World Bank

805
02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:09.900
Sajeevan G: And this particularly rural road program has an allevation of property, access to market, employment, healthcare, and education, and a lot of things has changed a bit. The PMGSY has worked.

806
02:06:13.530 --> 02:06:20.790
Sajeevan G: A little bit of history about the program, how we started into, let me come into a web GIS, the topic of my presentation today.

807
02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:36.330
Sajeevan G: And we have started with the PMGSY started with customizing the Arc, way back in 2005, and in that time it's 2005-6 you have even customize to

808
02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:41.010
Sajeevan G: WebGIS application, that is in MapXtreme.

809
02:06:45.450 --> 02:06:46.260
Okay, good.

810
02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:55.860
Sajeevan G: Okay, the web GISapplication, which is developed using ASP.Net and the engine behind is MapXtreme

811
02:06:56.190 --> 02:07:10.080
Sajeevan G: And if you look into this and we have worked as if like a standalone GIS software. You could see the map and this picture on the right side which is coccurrence here, you can see the users can make a lot of query like

812
02:07:12.150 --> 02:07:23.430
Sajeevan G: What is your habitation which is conducted or what is the village road. And the person is able to see the attribute information, just like a standalone system and see the details below.

813
02:07:26.130 --> 02:07:30.810
Sajeevan G: Coming currently, that was the history back in 2005-6 center.

814
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:42.780
Sajeevan G: Currently we have what is called GRRIS, that is open to public anybody can go to this particular site, pmgsy-grris.nic.in,

815
02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:55.200
Sajeevan G: A lot of information about the program is it and seeing it spatiallly how the data, how the things are connected, how the road is it is for the decision makers, as well as for the

816
02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:06.330
Sajeevan G: Public it is basically it is open to general public. Here also you could see the classifications, different category of populations we can make the

817
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:13.650
Sajeevan G: Colorful maps with a lot of legends and once you go into the particular system estate and it

818
02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:25.560
Sajeevan G: Can go there. Select the scheme, whether it is in the MPS via one or two or currently three is going on different schemes and in pitch. The government is approving particular type of roads.

819
02:08:26.010 --> 02:08:39.030
Sajeevan G: And basically, just started with the interconnecting, initially started with with habitations which are about 400 populations, and then Haley and

820
02:08:39.930 --> 02:08:49.020
Sajeevan G: Populations with the backward classes, SE and STD have started connecting with the 250 population, population mentioned a particular cluster of human

821
02:08:49.890 --> 02:09:02.520
Sajeevan G: Population in a habitation. The population should be 250 or above. And despite public publicly available system you have, so I can see the legend something around 23

822
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:17.310
Sajeevan G: Layers of GIS layers, arbitration, roads and drainage, a lot of information which is record for the managing and monitoring of the PMGSY program and we call it PMGSY National GIS to us to address it.

823
02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:26.490
Sajeevan G: Two most important positive things about this particular, particular web JS application, which is currently available.

824
02:09:26.850 --> 02:09:37.350
Sajeevan G: It is a live non spatial data integration the MIS and the GIS. Yes, we just have all the features that means we don't have any other information other than the ID and the spatial information.

825
02:09:38.130 --> 02:09:45.000
Sajeevan G: Information is coming from the MIS system that is cluster somewhere else and that particular

826
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:54.090
Sajeevan G: Application is also available for public information, omms.nic.in, which you can access. So they've already, what happening is

827
02:09:54.600 --> 02:10:04.590
Sajeevan G: The information, The information about each feature is getting updated within the OMMS MIS and within the GIS system we have the, just the spatial information.

828
02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:13.050
Sajeevan G: And bottles on top of each other and previously what you have seen and a particular thing here, even the information about the

829
02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:22.440
Sajeevan G: habitation, what do you have, a partition, name of the habitation, all the queries, everything coming from the main system, live. So this transcript to the particular

830
02:10:23.310 --> 02:10:31.530
Sajeevan G: System live on current, so that normally otherwise unless and until you updated GIS system. It is, it is very difficult to get updated.

831
02:10:32.130 --> 02:10:40.740
Sajeevan G: So, so it is almost as I showed you previously, which is working like a live standalone system, they user is able to query the system, user is about to get the result.

832
02:10:41.130 --> 02:10:57.840
Sajeevan G: And they are able to see the tables of the each feature, clicking on certain feature if you can see the, more information about that, and what he lacked in this particular engine, behind us a GRRIS is what I call the GRRIS, the previous software, it's

833
02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:07.200
Sajeevan G: Transaction based, so GIS engine it is mapping statement. And so we were trying to find out how we can transact with the day

834
02:11:07.770 --> 02:11:19.740
Sajeevan G: That GIS system you can update it online. So we have come up with Online Geospatial Transaction System that has been completely using free and open source software and

835
02:11:21.450 --> 02:11:35.010
Sajeevan G: Probably if the time permits, actually enforce them badly in another training program. So maybe fit as possible today or another day will be able to demonstrate if you're interested, but I will cover it up things and barely my

836
02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:52.470
Sajeevan G: Member parties also attending it but this the attendees, a developer of this particular system. And if time permits, or he can also show and demo here because I've been moving out to another program. So let's have a basic look into the

837
02:11:53.850 --> 02:12:04.020
Sajeevan G: the Geo server, what we call the online geospatial transaction system, means the user should be able to log in. it's based on authentication. There's a login screen.

838
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:13.020
Sajeevan G: And once the user is authenticated, the user can go and change the data online and basically start with uploading the data.

839
02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:20.520
Sajeevan G: And the beauty of the system is the shape files can be uploaded online. It could automatically published of it.

840
02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:33.360
Sajeevan G: And the system, whatever the user is. So previously, what used to happen, is he stayed in India is to send the data to see that used to manually do the quality controls. He started

841
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:42.870
Sajeevan G: Making the compatibility about how it is managed, and compatibility with a MIS system, how many features that's missing or how many are

842
02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:55.980
Sajeevan G: perfectly aligned with MIS system, so we check it manually and choose to send it. So now it is it'll be, system is currently live, but this waiting for launch. So I will not, maybe, probably not

843
02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:04.020
Sajeevan G: should not go into much detail. But the interesting thing is if users can upload the information, the shape file,

844
02:13:04.890 --> 02:13:20.070
Sajeevan G: And to make the reports online, see how things are, and modify the system online and also they can make a state a report, the after you get it, you add more data, how they are the status compared to

845
02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:29.370
Sajeevan G: The MIS system. How many are missing or these reports can be national report, as well as there is a utility portrays map. I will show you some slides and the subsequent

846
02:13:30.210 --> 02:13:37.170
Sajeevan G: presentation. So it is already the next slide. Also, there is an option to download the user so into

847
02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:51.150
Sajeevan G: The edit everything and the users can download the shape file online, and they can modify in case the regular again, they can upload it into the system, or they can modify it online. Also, there is an option to deliver

848
02:13:52.050 --> 02:14:05.700
Sajeevan G: The OGC standard web services to other agencies, because nowadays people are, as you know, it is asking for other publishers are asking for shape files, so the system is enriched with the giving the

849
02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:11.520
Sajeevan G: OGC standard geospatial service to other agencies.

850
02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:18.570
Sajeevan G: So this is about the editing I was talking about, once a user is logged in, there is an option to

851
02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:26.610
Sajeevan G: The based on the user, they will be taken to a particular area, it iss actually the user is not pointed it out, so this area of influence.

852
02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:35.760
Sajeevan G: So, for example, there is a, in every state there is a project implementation unit. So they will be given a login that will be so many

853
02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:45.840
Sajeevan G: logins and a state administrator who would be approving the whatever changes to party user. So from the left side of the list, to guess, you see here

854
02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:53.070
Sajeevan G: Left side of the drop down list, user can select any of the WFS services to be edited.

855
02:14:53.760 --> 02:15:04.620
Sajeevan G: And on the right side, you can also see WMS services. Basically the services coming from externally, the first service, you see the one

856
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:13.980
Sajeevan G: That is coming from Indian Space Research Organization. So the satellite data, you see, and this particular display, is coming. That is called Bhuvan.

857
02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:28.050
Sajeevan G: And satellite data. Also there is an option to access OpenStreetMap or any other satellite data can be added in the external service. And we know that the GIS layer's internal services which we created

858
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:38.880
Sajeevan G: Using WMS services or WFS services, which can be put into the background so that they will be very faster and people will be able to

859
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:44.250
Sajeevan G: See comparatively what is behind. Maybe the drainage, maybe the proposals, maybe the

860
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:52.290
Sajeevan G: Roads, and these are can also talk the information because information about some of the features, these are coming from the

861
02:15:52.650 --> 02:16:06.540
Sajeevan G: MIS access from the MIS registry. It's like the, behind this particular thing is the OpenLayers different than this OpenLayers and the back end. We have not many technologies like GeoServer

862
02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:09.360
Sajeevan G: also, some of the things in GDAL,

863
02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:16.440
Sajeevan G: Like, then postGIS, not so many differences in the backend

864
02:16:19.890 --> 02:16:26.610
Sajeevan G: So one utility, which I said the web services or web API because the system is having a lot of APIs and

865
02:16:27.930 --> 02:16:37.770
Sajeevan G: One thing I just wanted to show is the benefitted habitations because the people are interested, the MIS system is interested in knowing the benefitted habitations

866
02:16:38.970 --> 02:16:46.950
Sajeevan G: Supposedly constructed road, the things  you see in this particular whatever magenta or whatever color you see there, is a road.

867
02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:59.520
Sajeevan G: With the MIS system is passing to this particular to the GIS system in which he wants a habitation actually benefitted have constructing that road. So once we construct one road.

868
02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:10.050
Sajeevan G: The people are interested in knowing what other habitations, which has benefited out of it, but there may assess limitations, MIS people just enter it. They just say, okay, there's many habitations

869
02:17:10.650 --> 02:17:19.440
Sajeevan G: have benefited especially, is that true so that verification is done through the GIS system within the three kilometer radius. We take your the habitations.

870
02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:26.370
Sajeevan G: And also we find out the roads, how much it takes to reach each habitation. So it's a simulation because

871
02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:36.120
Sajeevan G: Simulation we do to, and a third sorry the not the simulation simulation. The next one is the finding out the shortest route to reach each habitation, whatever is within

872
02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:47.940
Sajeevan G: Three kilometer distance we are returning. Those are the benefitted habitations, that is the criteria defined by BMT so, so right side, y,ou could see the

873
02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:58.290
Sajeevan G: JSON string which is we want to the MIs system, and the left side you can see what is actually happening geospatial analysis. What we do internally to arrive.

874
02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:10.050
Sajeevan G: One more thing I just wanted to show you the simulation for road prioritization, what we call it a tracemap, I showed you the beginning so which road to be taken

875
02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:18.450
Sajeevan G: On priority for the construction or maintenance. That's what we are doing it over here. So since we,

876
02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:23.400
Sajeevan G: It's very difficult to keep on updating the traffic intensity, what we are doing the simulation.

877
02:18:23.730 --> 02:18:33.090
Sajeevan G: So what we are doing here is, it's it's particularly specifically for the PMGSY program which are right now to facilitate identification, priorities of roads

878
02:18:33.510 --> 02:18:44.430
Sajeevan G: So what we give is maybe we'll take the top 10 roads. Okay, these are the roads which we have suggested or the the system has suggested based on the

879
02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:53.220
Sajeevan G: shortest route and parameters of population. How many population that road is serving agricultural market, education, medical facility.

880
02:18:53.640 --> 02:19:03.450
Sajeevan G: Three important things which are going to control the marketplace, if there is marketplace or education institution or medical facility. So if there is a

881
02:19:03.930 --> 02:19:14.730
Sajeevan G: facility like this, so each habitations, as you see here is stored the people from that place will be moving to all these facilities. So we find from

882
02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:25.440
Sajeevan G: Each habitation these travels to all the facilities and people tracing the maps, it is a simulation continuously finding the shortest route and

883
02:19:26.010 --> 02:19:42.240
Sajeevan G: Finally, find out the top most or based on the frequency. It's like a heat map. So the talk most, maybe 10 the provider to that. The, the, here we can see the, maybe the red color is used to most of the time, so that should be taken for one priority to

884
02:19:43.290 --> 02:19:54.990
Sajeevan G: To. These are all I just am showing the some of the things which you do in GIS. So some of this suggestions will support my topic. Some of the suggestions say would like to give the Maps4HTML.

885
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.990
Sajeevan G: Hello.

886
02:20:01.140 --> 02:20:01.560
Sajeevan G: Hello.

887
02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:03.540
Sajeevan G: Hello, am I audible?

888
02:20:04.170 --> 02:20:05.430
Peter Rushforth: Oh, yes. Yeah.

889
02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:15.690
Sajeevan G: So before it support this for the understanding which may be useful for the programmers or that there's would be

890
02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:27.480
Sajeevan G: coding it. So all of us know the WGS85 ellipsoid/datum. So most important, people will be confused too. So they can go to this particular

891
02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:38.670
Sajeevan G: The upper or my research get topics and they can get to understand what you do. There is a confusion on many people can choose between the authalic latitude and geodetic latitude.

892
02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:49.620
Sajeevan G: So it is not the thing we are normally concerned, that is fear and and we're not constantly after the sphere, we are considering is an elipsoid so the geodatic latitude.

893
02:20:50.010 --> 02:20:58.710
Sajeevan G: At a location is the angle between the equatorial plane and in the line normal to the reference spheroid. That means in the case the user is standing at the point x

894
02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:16.800
Sajeevan G: There is a WJCT for ellipsoid, which I see the fly is the geodetic latitude. It's if it is an authalic latitude, that is around [inaudible] if it is standing that itself. So there is a really clearly difference between geodetic latitude and

895
02:21:18.930 --> 02:21:29.490
Sajeevan G: authalic latitude. So we should be very clear about where we're standing, we are find, when when you're taking the angle, you are taking the angle normal to the ellipsoid, or the

896
02:21:30.390 --> 02:21:48.840
Sajeevan G: spheroid surface. So that means to not go to the center, except for equator, all the North and South, whatever you consider. So this is very important in terms of spatial accuracy, because of the papers that I have, even you can go to that and

897
02:21:50.790 --> 02:22:07.680
Sajeevan G: So that we will not make compromise on the spatial accuracy. Another very interesting and important thing I just wanted to make a point of my, my suggestion is here, you can see both are from Google, on Google map in the left, and right side, I given a

898
02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:18.630
Sajeevan G: Green border, which is a global view where you can see the Greenland and how they shape and the size compared to Canada, you could see that.

899
02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:39.570
Sajeevan G: But at the same time, and the left side again land compared to the size you can say it is very small, because it is Mercator projection. And if you make some of the measurements on this, visually they appear really incorrect. So what I said, just a we could maybe probably go with

900
02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:51.210
Sajeevan G: This type of displays, like an acro view and sort of demonstrate people zoom in, zoom and zoom and they could take you to that particular place and then we can go with a

901
02:22:52.140 --> 02:23:00.690
Sajeevan G: Projection normal to that. So we could avoid for example in the next slide, I will show you the size of Antarctica.

902
02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:07.200
Sajeevan G: we can see that two years ago, we used to participate in Antarctic expeditions. If we feel bloated here.

903
02:23:07.650 --> 02:23:16.140
Sajeevan G: You can see it, since it's just the visual, it is going to be a incredibly important to use this in a particular projection. If you use assessment data projection.

904
02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:26.010
Sajeevan G: Or getting projection or whatever projection in the condition where if you use it, it's going to be really, really and [inaudible] to the size, shape and

905
02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:39.990
Sajeevan G: compared to that. So in fact, you can see in the right side, we could see the size of Antarctica when we put it in a global view. And what I suggest to based on this is how we are achieving it is what

906
02:23:41.070 --> 02:23:54.150
Sajeevan G: The thing is, okay, what I suggest a degree in can, avoid standard my projection and implement on the fly projection at the viewer. So, this we have implemented even in PMGSY,

907
02:23:55.260 --> 02:24:03.390
Sajeevan G: Which are talking about. So we just clearly said previously, what we used to have this. We used to have a base map over which people use to

908
02:24:03.810 --> 02:24:17.760
Sajeevan G: Broaden things. So here we have said not projection. So we don't have a projection. So what we have the normal geodetic latitude and longitude. People are mapping the information, the latitude and longitude probably they use the

909
02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:24.840
Sajeevan G: GPS unit or, if the previous map, what you have you need to convert those

910
02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:32.880
Sajeevan G: maps into proper W basic latitude and longitude. So

911
02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:45.330
Sajeevan G: They remain in the same, particularly if you start projecting the projection. Reprojection after reprojection, there's a chance of getting the accuracy getting lost. So what we actually, we are not living in

912
02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:57.870
Sajeevan G: An age of like a paper maps, so we could keep the paper map and we used to have used to have the coordinate system. Then once we have projected on to the, once we have the information or what the

913
02:24:58.590 --> 02:25:06.990
Sajeevan G: Ellipsoid or spheroid. Then the last stage, we used to take the projection where these cylindrical, conicalor others in the projection

914
02:25:07.290 --> 02:25:17.760
Sajeevan G: So we didn't have to do that. That's what I my point of view, is to keep the information there as and then where we just project it. So in the digital world, you can project and the last state.

915
02:25:18.060 --> 02:25:27.990
Sajeevan G: As I'm really critical. That's what is happening that someday maybe going again that is going to be the best practices bucket because you keep on keep reprojecting and reprojecting without confirm

916
02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:36.360
Sajeevan G: The way they might, there is a possibility of like the accuracy cutting costs. So the thing I just wanted to make again is a global view.

917
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:51.150
Sajeevan G: Like Google Odyssey, seen here, probably we can look into that pane and as well as location scale of it. So once you zoom into that you can be the informational assets or the projection the way you want. It is too much

918
02:25:52.110 --> 02:26:00.840
Sajeevan G: Goods and zoom when you can think of any of the like a way to like, Cartesian coordinate or projection in that we have, anything will do

919
02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:11.340
Sajeevan G: And location aware, where you are standing or if you keep the information of suppose a bit if it is in South Pole. If you get information based lat long

920
02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:23.160
Sajeevan G: Since you brought it here, they will appear very nicely. But if you keep it in already projected systems like Easting, Northing, those things. So the information transferring and converting

921
02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:39.330
Sajeevan G: It will be compromising on the quality, and also he suggested us as well as we need to be the permission to view the data services, which into maybe locally the information that people should be able to access the data web services.

922
02:26:40.350 --> 02:26:55.380
Sajeevan G: And as I already told you this spatial accuracy is very important so that we can have the interoperability properly so otherwise previously worked us to be normally we faced and in GIS, so a lot of the initial our data is in this and

923
02:26:55.860 --> 02:27:00.900
Sajeevan G: Polygon prediction. So in case anybody made a mistake and converting those things

924
02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:09.240
Sajeevan G: Without understanding the base projection and maybe they convert it into without understanding. Take the map and project it in WGS84

925
02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:19.410
Sajeevan G: That is going to be around, and it is very difficult to correct afterwards and listen until he recorded so, so that way the considering the spatial accuracy, you should

926
02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:35.190
Sajeevan G: Have it and there's some more suggestions, Okay, we should have definitely the way we obtain our to see time for the Web APIs to come. And the most, Another thing is a previous setting or speakers already talked about, cybersecurity. It is very important we

927
02:27:36.270 --> 02:27:45.240
Sajeevan G: Keep the cyber security in there, so that the user the expecting a trustworthy data. The data security is very important and

928
02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:55.560
Sajeevan G: The when I am expecting when I needed it, I should be the data should be available. I should not take the data security because what I meant, is because somebody should not manipulate the data

929
02:27:56.580 --> 02:28:06.630
Sajeevan G: Somewhere. So what we have here is the in the NGIS have authentication and set of privileges are given, and we have implemented some of the things in the way

930
02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:17.910
Sajeevan G: This is an order, since we could implement wherever possible. So when you're sharing the data right now in WMS and WFS services. Normally we are giving the URL.

931
02:28:18.510 --> 02:28:26.040
Sajeevan G: So we need to also work on how to authenticate those things properly so that somebody else is coming to know the URL.

932
02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:39.210
Sajeevan G: They should not be able to hijack the data. So we need to work on, so, authentication and authorization properly, so able to quantify maybe accessing your GeoServer or we should be able to

933
02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:50.850
Sajeevan G: Like, or we can manage those. And then case, I think previously someone was talking about some speakers are also talking about the prioritizing are selecting a multilateral position.

934
02:28:51.210 --> 02:28:59.790
Sajeevan G: That may be difficult. Maybe what they feed is how to prioritize it, or we may enter like a professional software like the commercial software.

935
02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:22.050
Sajeevan G: Maybe adding all the projections and datums. So initially, I think I have, you have a lot of collaborations with the Canada, PCH, Geomatica, initially get back in 2008 customized loading geomatica, that's used to be a very powerful, especially in projection and everything, that was really

936
02:29:23.130 --> 02:29:23.820
Sajeevan G: Good product.

937
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:32.760
Sajeevan G: And with this initiative, I think we should expect enormous contribution from the developer community. So the HTML mapping work,

938
02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:43.290
Sajeevan G: And if you are able to put it into an HTML. So the contributions coming from the developers around the world. So the

939
02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:51.750
Sajeevan G: The geospatial data as a service could be the next a business opportunity like two people could serve based on their requirement. I'm interested in

940
02:29:52.230 --> 02:29:55.650
Sajeevan G: Keeping my entire data here, I may be interested in only a small or

941
02:29:56.220 --> 02:30:05.910
Sajeevan G: Maybe I just wanted to see what is the benefit application, so I didn't have to keep all the data. I just want maybe a one time requirements or somebody else could be in the service and

942
02:30:06.210 --> 02:30:18.570
Sajeevan G: I could use those data so we should expect maybe a data as a service geospatial data. So this could be a next thing. And thank you all, it is a,

943
02:30:19.980 --> 02:30:21.780
Sajeevan G: In case, maybe you can have

944
02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:31.230
Sajeevan G: The question answer or in case you want a demo, my member part can give or two, we can

945
02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:34.530
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Thank you Sajeevan, unfortunately, we

946
02:30:34.530 --> 02:30:34.920
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Are

947
02:30:34.980 --> 02:30:44.580
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Well over time today. So we won't do that. But maybe getting in touch with the program committee, we might have time for that demo later in the week.

948
02:30:46.770 --> 02:30:52.710
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: And thank you, you covered so many different issues. I'm sure there will be discussion.

949
02:30:53.730 --> 02:30:55.950
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Follow up with

950
02:30:57.330 --> 02:31:00.600
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: The discourse pages and

951
02:31:02.910 --> 02:31:07.350
Amelia Bellamy-Royds: Many threads of ideas there, there has been already lots of interesting

952
02:31:07.380 --> 02:31:09.180
Peter Rushforth: Discussion and so
