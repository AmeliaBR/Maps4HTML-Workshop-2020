07:41 <nicolocarpignoli> Okay I think I found it,  I  see Ted Guild (Host) currently connected
07:52 <tguild> @nicolocarpignoli if you want to do an audio+video check before we start, feel free
07:53 <nicolocarpignoli> No worries, thanks anyway
08:17 <prushforth> @nicolocarpignoli  All these requirements are excellent.  What I fail to understand is why we don't work on solving them in standards, as a community. IMHO first step is to agree that maps can be standardized as a user level feature of browsers.  Thanks for helping make the case for that.
08:18 <thehabes> If there were more time, I think Collaboration is another main use, in academics and research especially.  That opens the "Web" can of worms, so to speak.
08:18 <nicolocarpignoli> I absolutely agree with you @prushforth , that should be the direction. @thehabes  nice catch! 
08:20 <RealJoshue108> hello and apologies for being late
08:21 <shepazu> Great presentation! Not exactly the first mention of accessibility in this workshop, though :)
08:22 <RealJoshue108> anyone able to share zoom info?
08:22 <prushforth> Joshue I will email it to you
08:24 <thehabes> @nicolocarpignoli , we use Web Annotation (https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) to pass these kinds of textual data nodes around.  If you haven't seen that yet, this is how I can provide those pieces of requirement metadata when it isn't already a part of Map data, or when I mean to supplement information without overwriting it or changing the source data.  It is interesting, and may be of interest to you depending on
08:24 <thehabes> you feel about Annotation.  
08:24 <RealJoshue108> thanks Peter
08:24 <RealJoshue108> am in
08:24 <RealJoshue108> @RealJoshue108 wavets
08:24 <RealJoshue108> @RealJoshue108 waves even..
08:26 <satakagi> @prushforth 
08:26 <satakagi> I have a view that may differ slightly. I'm sure you're already aware of that.
08:26 <satakagi>  I believe that the function of a geographic map should be a higher conceptual function that encompasses other usages that have a similar functions.
08:27 <nicolocarpignoli> @thehabes did not know them. I will definitely give a look. @RealJoshue108 that might interest you too (see previous Bryan's comment)
08:28 <RealJoshue108> thanks @nicolocarpignoli 
08:31 <prushforth> @satakagi Are referring to non-geographic maps, such as deep zoom on images?
08:32 <satakagi> @prushforth Yes! That's what Amelia's report refers to as well.
08:33 <thehabes> Is touch a reason why I remember things better when I physically write them down on something?  I am just one of those people where I drop pieces of audible conversation from my memory, but when I write it down I never have to look at the note to remember it.
08:34 <prushforth> @satakagi my question around that is: do the coordinate systems of deep zoom applications need to be unique?  Can they re-use tiled coordinate reference systems, or a tiled coordinate system defined explicitly for deep zoom applications?
08:38 <prushforth> Doug says that the primitives we need for maps are already there
08:40 <prushforth> Sort of... he says a combo of standards and innovation will need to be applied to making maps accessible
08:40 <thehabes> @ghobona Are there other accessibility schema/ontology/APIs you have worked on like IndoorGML http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-005r5/14-005r5.html.  I agree with Doug.  As a developer, a schema or standard has to exist for me to even begin to know what accessibility users need.
08:40 <nicolocarpignoli> @prushforth What are those primitives? Is he referring to "Web Annotation" spec too, or something else?
08:41 <prushforth> the audio api, the vibration api were the specific ones he mentioned iirc
08:42 <shepazu> I'm not sure rasters are that useless… there's a lot of innovation in machine vision on that front
08:42 <shepazu> Of course, I prefer vector data with annotations, like SVG
08:42 <prushforth> [edit] @satakagi my question around that is: do the coordinate systems of deep zoom applications need to be unique?  Can they re-use tiled coordinate reference systems, or a tiled coordinate system defined explicitly for deep zoom applications?
08:42 <satakagi> I'll make a thread about this topic.
08:42 <satakagi> The quadrant tree tile pyramid structure, which has become well known in googleMaps, can be found in things that have nothing to do with geography, for example, JPEG 2000: https://northstar-www.dartmouth.edu/doc/idl/html_6.2/ Image_Tiling.html
08:42 <satakagi> I think it's relatively common for these data structures to be defined independently of geography, and for there to be something else to associate them with geographic coordinates.

08:44 <satakagi> That is, if your mention of "tilted coordinate reference systems" is not geographical, then it seems relatively reasonable.
08:45 <nicolocarpignoli> I think too we already have all the technologies (as standards one) that can be used to make an accessible map viewer. We can use ARIA attributes - if not  new attributes - in order to  tag elements and create the labels I talked about on all the user needs I  showcased. This is one way to do that.
08:46 <shepazu> I think the standards Tony is talking about, UX around earcons and auditory icons, is really important, even though it probably doesn't fit at W3C or (maybe) OGC… definitely something that needs to be followed up with, maybe with ICAD (International Conference on Auditory Display) 
08:46 <prushforth> [edit] @satakagi my question around that is: do the coordinate systems of deep zoom applications need to be unique?  Can they re-use tiled coordinate reference systems, or a tiled coordinate system defined explicitly for deep zoom applications?
08:46 <prushforth> I don't see why a tiled coordinate reference system has to be geographic in nature; it might be confusing if we re-used a geographic tcrs for a non-geographic map application.  Perhaps need to define one for non-geo maps
08:46 <RealJoshue108> +1 to @nicolasG - also shows that we need clear understanding of user needs for accessible maps
08:46 <thehabes> If the Event structure is layed out well, it is easy to apply unit actions to those events.  For example, if a `click` event always produced a little click noise, it is pretty easy to go into that and change it to produce little click noise + vibration
08:47 <thehabes> I would be curious to know how to design an Event structure for accessibility needs, I have never seen one of those before.

08:47 <shepazu> From a web standards perspective, I agree we now have the basic building blocks
08:47 <RealJoshue108> @thehabes as we know the click event is also critical for a11y as it is event agnostic
08:48 <RealJoshue108> works for keyboard only users, switch user etc
08:49 <prushforth> [edit] @satakagi my question around that is: do the coordinate systems of deep zoom applications need to be unique?  Can they re-use tiled coordinate reference systems, or a tiled coordinate system defined explicitly for deep zoom applications?
08:49 <satakagi> Maybe I'm mistaken?
08:49 <satakagi> The "tilted coordinate reference systems" you are mentioning is one that does not have a geographical concept?
08:49 <thehabes> @RealJoshue108 Exactly, I was primed by the presentations from yesterday that brought this stuff up.  Most Events have direct equivalents for those with disabilities, but it also occurs to me some Events will never happen for some users (perhaps they can't use a keyboard or mouse, so `click` is right out).  
08:50 <RealJoshue108> sounds good @thehabes 
08:50 <nicolocarpignoli> [edit] I think too we already have all the technologies (as standards one) that can be used to make an accessible map viewer.

08:50 <prushforth> Doug this is the case I'm trying to make around maps: the primitives all exist, *including* map semantics (image maps / layers).  Just need a little imagination and willingness to go there from the browsers

08:52 <satakagi> [edit] Maybe I'm misunderstood?
08:52 <satakagi> [edit] The "tilted coordinate reference systems" you are mentioning is one that does not have a geographical concept?
08:54 <prushforth> The problem with calling for user research is what the focus of the research is in terms of what map implementation should receive the results.  A standard for maps would help with that imho.
08:55 <prushforth> The web platform should have maps is what I'm saying

08:56 <prushforth> So "tiled coordinate reference system" is a specific discussion of MapML https://maps4html.org/MapML/spec/#examples
08:57 <shepazu> Honored to be on that panel with such knowledgeable innovators
08:57 <prushforth> [edit] @satakagi my question around that is: do the coordinate systems of deep zoom applications need to be unique?  Can they re-use tiled coordinate reference systems, or a tiled coordinate system defined explicitly for deep zoom applications?
08:57 <prushforth> But I'm just saying these all, so far, associate a gcrs and pcrs, whereas in a non-geographic map, perhaps there wouldn't need to be a gcrs?
08:59 <AmeliaBR> Yes, @prushforth, I think the implicit conclusion of this panel is that there should be a standard way for web page authors to share map data, so that browsers or browser extensions can build on it with auditory/haptic experiences.
09:02 <prushforth> [edit] @satakagi my question around that is: do the coordinate systems of deep zoom applications need to be unique?  Can they re-use tiled coordinate reference systems, or a tiled coordinate system defined explicitly for deep zoom applications?
09:02 <satakagi> "OSMTILE" seems to have the meaning of the tiles used in Mercator's openStreetMap, which are associated with longitude and latitude.
09:02 <satakagi> Is it my mistake?
09:03 <thehabes> I agree that Object of Interest probably goes outside the scope of what GeoJSON is trying to do.  
09:04 <prushforth> [edit] @satakagi my question around that is: do the coordinate systems of deep zoom applications need to be unique?  Can they re-use tiled coordinate reference systems, or a tiled coordinate system defined explicitly for deep zoom applications?

09:04 <satakagi> [edit] Am I misunderstanding that?
09:04 <thehabes> ROI and POI is doable, but leveraging `properties` as a wildcard is a Bad Idea.  It is best to extend GeoJSON or apply your own schema to the `properties` object.

09:09 <prushforth> [edit] The web platform should have maps is what I'm saying
09:09 <RealJoshue108> If there is a <map> element - then that could have dedicated semantics to support various user needs.
09:10 <prushforth> [edit] The web platform should have maps is what I'm saying
09:10 <RealJoshue108> I don't think it is sufficient to just throw a ton of ARIA labels at e'thing!
09:10 <RealJoshue108> They have a place for sure - but we need to work out where generic labelling and descriptive semantics are just not enought.
09:10 <prushforth> [edit] The web platform should have maps is what I'm saying
09:11 <prushforth> [edit] The web platform should have maps is what I'm saying
09:11 <RealJoshue108> there may also be particular behaviours etc associated with custom elements/attributes etc that we need to consider.
09:11 <prushforth> [edit] The web platform should have maps is what I'm saying
09:11 <prushforth> Yes! The <map> element already exists, and does have map/layer semantics, although it has been very much neglected
09:11 <prushforth> [edit] The web platform should have maps is what I'm saying

09:17 <satakagi> Thanks for confirming that.
09:17 <satakagi> Roughly, I'm expecting something like the following
09:17 <satakagi> <geographic map layer>.
09:17 <satakagi> <something that relates the coordinates of an image to something geographical (projection or latitude and longitude (geographic coordinates) />).
09:17 <satakagi> <deepZoomImage

09:48 <nicolocarpignoli> Talking about AR and Navigation: I'm the maintainer of AR.js that from version 3 features Location Based AR. The code is totally Open Source if you want to give it a look. I have used it in order to create AR geolocated trasure-hunts or other AR cultural-discovering  web  app for historical center of cities.

10:07 <shepazu> Based on how SVG, a 2D vector format, is inappropriate to extend to 3D, I think maybe 3D should be considered from the beginning, rather than hoping to extend it later

10:10 <shepazu> Regarding @AdaRoseCannon's comment about WebGL+HTML, maybe a shadow-DOM approach like was designed for Canvas might be suitable
10:11 <prushforth> kml + google earth show the way to 3d in the browser, perhaps.  2d services are still important even in that application
10:11 <AdaRoseCannon> The nice thing with Vector formats is that they can be parsed and rendered with geometry. 
10:12 <AdaRoseCannon> [edit] The nice thing with Vector formats is that they can be parsed and rendered with geometry. 
10:12 <shepazu> True, but the structure of SVG isn't suited for 3D
10:12 <IvanSanchez_gitlab> Somehow I'm still convinced that the right way would be a SVG-like language that *leverages* GL abstract concepts, like SVG abstracted 2D drawing APIs back in the day
10:12 <AdaRoseCannon> There are also ways to render SVG in the graphics card using https://github.com/servo/pathfinder

10:26 <AmeliaBR> Augmented City

10:27 <cperey_twitter> yes, thank you all on inputs and if you want to follow up, please reach out to me at cperey@perey.com
10:28 <rahola_gitlab> Question from @shepazu if we should integrate 2 and 3D to start, rather than only focusing on 2D. Could this drive more use cases and possibly interest?
10:32 <briankardell_twitter> is this not like a split between 2d and 3d in general tho?
10:32 <thehabes> Even with the 2D stuff, the goal is to make each piece extendable so you never have to throw anything away (or at least only need too in the most extreme cases)
10:33 <thehabes> I imagine the challenge of the time dimension is nearly the same for 2D and 3D POI/ROI/OiM.
10:33 <thehabes> A "timeline" in a 3D sense is like watching a building being built in fast motion.
10:34 <thehabes> [edit] Even with the 2D stuff, the goal is to make each piece extendable so you never have to throw anything away (or at least only need to in the most extreme cases)
10:35 <RealJoshue108> thanks for a great sesssion
10:35 <prushforth> That was a lot of fun
10:44 <rahola_gitlab> Reminder to all that the next workshop session will start tomorrow (Sept. 30) at 16:00 UTC (12:00 PM EDT). 
10:47 <nicolocarpignoli> Thank you all!
11:56 <prushforth> It's going to take me some time to thoughtfully and appropriately respond to many comments in this chat feed.  I think I will try to do that mostly on [discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/c/web-mapping/22), so that it's a bit more permanent and public. Thanks to @AmeliaBR  and @satakagi  who've copied some of the comments from here to there already.  I encourage others to offer their ideas over there too.  That is
11:56 <prushforth> where Web platform developers discuss Web platform ideas, so even if they have muted us due to the onslaught of Web mapping content these past few days, they will have a handy reference at their fingertips.
12:31 <NicolasRafaelPalomino> To answer your questions @AmeliaBR ;"The data that will be used to train the software really depends on the features of the widgets. I believe the best way is offering industrial or commercial geospatial data to interact with through the widgets will give us a good possibility to harness data... What we harness  harness could be anything between data from the services that are provided by the place
12:31 <NicolasRafaelPalomino> such as ordering, checking availability , paying, or as just as capturing interactions with data that is available. Then applying''machine learning'' to deep analytics and big data analysis to the information that is generated from the interaction with the geospatial data can be used for better insight. The "AI" will be the automation of this data for improvements in effectiveness of their
12:31 <NicolasRafaelPalomino> organizations.  The idea is to fuse that data together and draw conclusions and then present that information very quickly to drive change in how we manufacture, schedule and predict resources and outcomes, it is really about moving from data to answers.
