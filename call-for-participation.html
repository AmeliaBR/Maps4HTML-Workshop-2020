    <h1>Call For Participation</h1>
    <p>This will be a three day workshop that brings together people with an interest in the future 
        of Web standards relating to maps and spatial information on the Web.</p>

    <p>The scope includes:</p>
    <i>The current list of workshop topics, subject to change, being discussed are:</i>

    <ul>
        <li>a native map viewer, like that provided for video content</li>
        <li>standards for how such a map widget might use map services links</li>
        <li>Integration / relationship of maps and location with other browser APIs, e.g. geo-video, geolocation API, forms, SVG</li>
        <li>semantic rendering of spatial “things” to support spatial accessibility</li>
        <li>standardized browser elements and APIs</li>
        <li>CSS styling of maps and map features</li>
        <li>Map feature creation / forms</li>
        <li>federated map services with linking</li>
        <li>accessibility of browser maps</li>
        <li>security of browser-based maps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The workshop will be two days of presentation and discussions, followed by one day of hands-on hacking, allowing participants to go in depth into proposals for further collaboration.</p>

    <p>The objective of the workshop is to establish a common vision among participants of how the Web platform could evolve to support accessible maps and spatial information.</p>  

    <h2>How can I participate?</h2>
<p>Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.</p>
<p>If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the application form. The application form asks 
    several questions about your background and ideas; please give these questions serious thought. 
    In addition to the application form, you are encouraged to submit a presentation topic in the form of a position statement.</p>
<p>Because the venue has limited space, you must receive an acceptance email in order to attend. 
    You might wish to defer making non-refundable travel arrangements until you receive an invitation. 
    Be sure to keep an eye on these important dates.</p>
<p>Our aim is to get diverse attendance from a variety of individuals with different backgrounds and experiences including Web map, 
    Web standards and browser developers, product owners/managers, business development, corporate strategy and innovation from the 
    various industries and sectors that will be the future of transportation:</p>

<h2 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h2>
<p>Application and position statement deadline: 2 to 3 months prior to workshop ie late March.</p>
<p>Acceptance notifications: Application and position statement deadline + 2 weeks - early April</p>
<p>Program announcement: Workshop date-1.5 months ie late April - early May.</p>
<p>Workshop held: late June, hopefully at the OGC meeting in Montreal, of which we don’t know the dates or venue yet.</p>

<h2>How can I suggest a presentation?</h2>
<p>This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and 
    decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.</p>
<p>In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.</p>
<p>If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement by the deadline (see <a href="#important-dates">important dates</a>). Our program committee 
    will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.</p>

<p>A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Submissions should be between 200 and 1000 words.</li>
    <li>Your background in the main topic areas of the workshop.</li>
    <li>Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.</li>
    <li>Links to related supporting resources.</li>
    <li>Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.</li>
    <li>A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.</li>
    <li>Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. You may include multiple topics, 
        but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration 
        time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.</li>
</ul>
