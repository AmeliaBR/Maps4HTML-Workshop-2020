<p>
The W3C/OGC Joint Workshop on Maps for the Web

at the CAE Montreal training centre.
</p>
<p>
The workshop will be co-located with

  <p>
    The programming committee is aware that travel restrictions
    related to the 2020 coronavirus outbreak may prevent many people
    from joining us in Montreal.
    We ask all participants to keep their registration status up-to-date,
    so that we know how many participants will be joining in person
    and how many remotely.
  </p>
  <p>
    If too few people can come in person,
    or if the spread of the virus results in
    public health agencies recommending against travel to Montreal,
    it is possible that the in-person workshop may be cancelled or rescheduled.
    Please keep this in mind when making travel reserverations.
