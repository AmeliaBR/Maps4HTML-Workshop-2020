      <p>Location information is becoming increasingly important for human activity and survival. 
         Web maps are an essential method of communicating location to users, 
         across millions of Web sites and billions of people worldwide, especially on mobile platforms. Maps are 
         the main medium of communicating location to users, and the lack of direct support for maps in the 
         Web platform is an obvious barrier to adoption and growth of the mobile Web, when compared to proprietary
         platforms.
      </p>

      <p>A W3C Workshop is now planned for mid 2020 on emerging standardisation opportunities. This will be a two day workshop, 
          spread over three days, that brings together people with an interest in the future of standards relating to maps and location, 
          drawing upon the experience gained over the last two decades. The workshop will look at the emerging standardisation 
          opportunities relating to the importance of location to the Web platform, and what's needed to better support 
          maps for users and authors of all abilities.</p>

      <p>For more details on the workshop, see the <a href="index">Mapping Workshop page</a>.</p>

      <p>Sponsoring the W3C Workshop on Web Map Standardization helps move the dialog forward.</p>

        <h3 id="why">Why Sponsor This Workshop?</h3>
        <p>The cost to hold a workshop includes costs for venue (including setup and custodial costs), AV requirements (optionally including recording), catering (lunch and breaks), materials, travel and staffing, and other considerations.</p>

        <p>Most of the planning, coordination, agenda building, and writing outcome reports are done for no cost by W3C staff or volunteers. But without sponsorships, W3C cannot hold workshops.</p>

        <p>If you see value in discussing the expected evolutions of networking and Web technologies, and believe it will help your business, sponsoring is the best way to ensure that this conversation happens, and that you are seen as a leader and a forward-looking enabler of the technical evolution of the Web.</p>

        <p>The more sponsorships we get, the better the amenities will be, including options like recording and transcription for spreading and preserving what was discussed, and better meals.</p>
