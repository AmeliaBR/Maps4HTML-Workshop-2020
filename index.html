        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Maps are a facet of our daily lives.  From deciding what route to take to work,
       to vacation planning, to researching the effects of climate change, the Web provides maps that guide
       our decisions and inform our world view. The rise of powerful mobile processors and access to open and free high resolution
       spatial information yields the opportunity to augment the access of every citizen to location information. </p>

    <p>The unprecedented growth in map content is driven by factors such as advances in mobile computing,
        and a broad and growing recognition of the importance of the location of and visualization of spatial information
        in decision making.  We see evidence of this in the growth of world wide contributions to projects such as
        Open Street Map, as well as in the public investments by governments in open spatial data infrastructures.</p>

    <p>From a standards perspective however, there is an important story to tell. The geospatial information
        community has, for more than two decades, developed standards and applications that support and secure
        the infrastructural investments that society has made, and is making, in geospatial content.  Certainly, lessons about
        the ingredients for successful geospatial information standards have been learned, some the hard way.</p>

    <p>World wide, spatial data infrastructures and Web map content are accessed through services that implement OGC standards such as the Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS), Catalog Services, Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) and other standards.
        There is a distinct trend towards JSON-ified hypermedia API versions of all of these legacy standards,
        making this content accessible to Web developers in a simplified fashion. The recently published <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ogcapi-features">OGC API - Features</a> standard is a response, in part, to the growing popularity of Web APIs. And yet, there are few dedicated Web platform standards to support and unify this growth.  The support the Web platform offers is purely
        that of a scripted rendering platform, which results in a suboptimal use of resources by society by
        keeping the bar to using map content too high.</p>

    <p>This workshop is dedicated to uncovering how the evolving Web platform could help society by
        lowering barriers to Web mapping, and by unifying the burgeoning universe of standard and
        non-yet-standard spatial information. Topics of interest include:</p>

    <ul><li>a native map viewer, like that provided for video content</li>
    <li>standards for how such a map widget might use map services links</li>
    <li>semantic rendering of spatial “things” to support spatial accessibility</li>
    <li>standardized browser elements and APIs </li>
    <li>map feature styling, accessibility, creation / forms</li>
    <li>federated map services with linking</li>
    <li>?</li>
</ul>
