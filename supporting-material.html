  Essential background reading for
  the W3C/OGC Joint Workshop Series on Maps for the Web, 15−17 June, 2020 in Montreal.

<p>
  This page collects background reading material
  from and for workshop participants.
</p>

<div class="info">
  <p>
    Participants are invited to submit summaries of their projects and priorities,
    for review by others before the event.
    See the <a href="{{ '/call-for-participation' | relative_url }}">call for participation</a> for more.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the formal position statements from individuals and organizations,
    the organizers welcome suggestions of links to
    related standards, research, reports,
    proposals and explainers,
    software projects, or datasets.
    These can be submitted by email to the
    <a href="{{ '/call-for-participation#programming-committee' | relative_url }}">programming committee</a>,
    or by <a href="https://github.com/Maps4HTML/Maps4HTML-Workshop-2020/issues">filing a GitHub issue</a>
    on the workshop series website.
  </p>

<h2 id="position-statements">Participant Position Statements</h2>

<p>
Position statements can be submitted on behalf of an organization,
or as an individual.
Either way, they should be short introductions,
to help other workshop participants understand your priorities and experience.

<h2 id="reports-explainers">Related Standards, Proposals and Other Reports</h2>

<p>
  Existing standards for online geospatial data provide relevant context;
  successful ones should be integrated into maps for the web,
  while less successful ones provide important warnings.
  Proposals can be compared and critiqued,
  to find the shared goals and strategies.
  Reports compiling requirements for different use cases
  provide a framework for measuring those proposals.

  MapML and related proposals from the Maps for HTML Community Group
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The Maps for HTML Community Group is a W3C community
    of individuals and organizations who share the objective
    of extending HTML with maps and location.

    <li><a href="https://maps4html.org/">Links and info</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A primary focus of work has been a proposal for
    a native HTML <code>map</code> element,
    and a matching markup-based map layer data format, MapML:

<dt id="maps4html-use-cases">
  Use Cases and Requirements for Standardizing Web Maps
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    An on-going effort by members of the Maps for HTML Community Group,
    to comprehensively summarize requirements for a native HTML web map viewer,
    by reviewing the capabilities of existing (JavaScript-based) map viewers
    currently used on the Web.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://maps4html.org/HTML-Map-Element-UseCases-Requirements/">Draft report</a></li>

  </ul>

<dt id="OGC-standards">OGC standards for Web map services</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  World wide, spatial data infrastructures and Web map content are accessed
  through services that implement OGC standards, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms">Web Map Service (WMS)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/wfs">Web Feature Service (WFS)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/cat">Catalog Services</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/wmts">Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a distinct trend towards JSON-ified
  hypermedia API versions of all of these legacy standards, making this content
  accessible to Web developers in a simplified fashion. The recently published
  <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ogcapi-features"
    >OGC API - Features</a>
  standard is a response, in part, to the growing popularity of Web APIs.

<h2 id="projects">Software Projects and Geospatial Data</h2>

<p>
Many organizations, both open/non-profit and commercial,
are actively working on Web map software and supporting data sets.
Their experience is essential for a standardization effort.
