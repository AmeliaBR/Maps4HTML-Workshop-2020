        <h1>W3C Workshop on Maps for the Web</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Mapping has become a ubiquitous facet of our daily lives.  From deciding what route to take to work, 
        to vacation planning, to researching the effects of climate change, the Web provides maps that guide 
        our decisions and inform our world view. The rise of powerful mobile processors and high resolution 
        spatial information yields to society the opportunity to augment the access of every citizen to spatial “things”. </p>
    
    <p>The unprecedented growth in map content is driven by factors such as advances in machine learning, 
        and a broad and growing recognition of the importance of the location of and access to spatial “things”, 
        in decision making.  We see evidence of this in the growth of world wide contributions to projects such as 
        Open Street Map, as well as in the public investments by governments in spatial data infrastructures.</p>
    
    <p>From a standards perspective however, there is an important story to tell. The geospatial information 
        community has, for more than two decades, developed standards and applications that support and secure 
        the investments that society has made, and is making, in geospatial content.  Certainly, lessons about 
        the ingredients for successful geospatial information standards have been learned, some the hard way.</p>     

    <p>World wide, spatial data infrastructures and Web map content are accessed through standards-based 
        services such as Web Map (Tile) Services, Web Feature Service, Catalog Services and others.  
        There is a distinct trend towards JSON-ified hypermedia API versions of all of these legacy standards, 
        making this content accessible to Web developers in a simplified fashion. And yet, there are no dedicated 
        Web platform standards to support and unify this growth.  The support the Web platform offers is purely 
        that of a scripted rendering platform, which results in a suboptimal use of resources by society by 
        keeping the bar to using map content too high.</p>
    
    <p>This workshop is dedicated to uncovering how the evolving Web platform could help society by 
        lowering barriers to Web mapping, and by unifying the burgeoning universe of standard and 
        non-yet-standard spatial information. Topics of interest include:</p>
     
    <ul><li>a native map viewer, like that provided for video content</li>
    <li>standards for how such a map widget might use map services links</li>
    <li>semantic rendering of spatial “things” to support spatial accessibility</li>
    <li>standardized browser elements and APIs </li>
    <li>map feature styling, accessibility, creation / forms</li>
    <li>federated map services with linking</li>
    <li>?</li>
</ul>
